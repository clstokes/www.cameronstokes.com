<div class="entry-content"><p><em>My fiancé Rhonda and I have picked up and moved to Seattle so that she can pursue a job at Boeing working on their 787 Dreamliner. We opted to make the cross-country drive rather than fly. This series of posts will be a recap of our drive. Here&#8217;s our adventure&#8230;</em></p>

<h1>Day 2</h1>

<p>After watching it rain and hail for about 30 minutes Tuesday morning it finally settled down and I examined the tarp over the truck bed. I commended myself for such a fine jimmy-rigging job and after a quick breakfast we hit the road. Thanks to Google Maps we missed our exit onto I-70 and a few U-turns later we were on the right road.</p>

<p>The drive through Missouri and Nebraska was boring and uneventful. It was windy, testing the limits of our tarp. After feeling as if the truck were going to take off from the road after a big gust we pulled over and removed the tarp for the rest of the drive. It was this stop when we realized we may have under-packed for the trip, not realizing how cold it was in the rest of the country. Stopping for gas, I was confused that <em>Plus</em> was the cheapest gas, but soon realized it was because of the added <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_fuel">ethanol</a> (Thanks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005">government subsidized agriculture</a>!). We made decent time thanks to the 75 MPH speed limit through the state.</p>

<p>Our destination for day 2 was dinner with Kenneth, a long-time friend and co-worker, in Kearney, NE. Of course I picked a beer stop for us; <a href="http://http://www.thunderheadbrewing.com/">Thunderhead Brewing Company</a>. I had first heard about Thunderhead on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brewing_Network">The Brewing Network</a> and was surprised that little, ol&#8217; Kearney could have such a cool sounding brewpub. With over 10 beers on tap I had two samplers of their beers. Their fruit-flavored wheats were tasty but their cream ale and dry stout were my favorites. From The Brewing Network show I learned Thunderhead uses corn in several of their beers and you can certainly taste it in their cream ale. Catching up with Kenneth was fun. Rhonda had heard plenty of stories about Kenneth and she enjoyed finally meeting him. After dinner we were off to our hotel in Lexington, NE, another 30 miles down the road. Lexington was unremarkable except for the smell&#8230;</p>

<p>The highlight of the drive was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Platte_River_Road_Archway_Monument">Great Platte River Road Archway Monument</a>, an archway extending across I-80. According to Kenneth it&#8217;s deemed a &#8220;temporary&#8221; structure through a loophole in the Interstate Highway System program, allowing its construction.</p>

<p>Total driving on day 2 was over 600 miles through Missouri, the corner of Iowa, and Nebraska.</p>

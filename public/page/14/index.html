  <div class="entry-content"><p>Netflix <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/2008/11/19/microsofts-new-xbox-experience/">recently</a> opened up their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix#Watch_Instantly">Watch Instantly</a> service to external platforms such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">XBOX 360</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiVo">TiVo</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roku">Roku</a>, and others increasing their potential audience of the service to users who don&#8217;t want to sit at their computer to watch a movie or TV show.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve since watched over 40 videos through the service on my 360 and after the most recent one I received an email from Netflix asking me to rate picture quality was.  The options are <em>The quality was very good</em>, <em>The quality was acceptable</em>, and <em>The quality was unacceptable</em>.  The survey seems simple and innocent enough but has some interesting implications behind the answers.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-454 " title="netflix-determining-your-video-quality" src="http://cameronstokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/netflix-determining-your-video-quality.png" alt="Determining your video quality" width="472" height="322" /></p>

<p>The quality of your video stream is determined when you first start the video and adjusts if the player notices your connection slowing.  A change in quality is fairly seamless on a computer and happens while the video streams.  If it happens, you&#8217;ll see the sharpness of the video increase and decrease as the video continues to play.  The player on the 360 has to stop the video and re-buffer the stream when changing the quality.</p>

<p>What makes the survey interesting is that it allows Netflix to conduct an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing">a/b test</a> to find the right blend between quality and cost to stream a video.  Netflix can test different levels of stream quality, say on a scale of <em>1-5</em>, and then survey their customers to find the ideal quality level right between where their customers are happy and when they start to complain.  If customers complain at <em>level 2</em> but say <em>level 3</em> is acceptable then Netflix can stream at <em>level 3</em> and no worry about the added cost of <em>levels 4 or 5</em>.</p>

<p>Netflix could take this a step further and adjust stream quality per user based on their individual feedback.  If I consistently rate videos streamed at <em>level 4</em> as acceptable and <em>level 3</em> as unacceptable yet another user rates <em>level 3</em> as acceptable and <em>level 2</em> as unacceptable, they could customize the stream quality for each of us to minimize their cost.  Again, there&#8217;s no point in streaming at a higher quality if neither of us notice.</p>

<p>This is the ideal case when it comes to conducting a/b testing and gathering customer feedback.  This allows Netflix to better serve their customers and also reduce their costs.  In the end, I answered the survey that the <em>The quality was acceptable</em>.  I&#8217;m not sure what video quality I was receiving but it was perfectly watchable and I never once thought that it didn&#8217;t look as good as it should.  At the same time, it was an older movie and not one that would be commended on its special effects or impressive scenery so I didn&#8217;t think it deserved a <em>The quality was very good</em>.</p>

<p>You can read more about how Netflix&#8217;s streaming technology works in a surprisingly detailed post on their blog titled <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2008/11/encoding-for-streaming.html"><em>Encoding for streaming</em></a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having taken a <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/2009/01/04/2008-in-review/">look back at 2008</a>, it&#8217;s time to look forward to 2009.  Here are my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_resolution">New Year&#8217;s resolutions</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Plan more</strong> - Be more proactive and less reactive.</li>
<li><strong>Spend less</strong> - Reduce money spent on luxury items, particularly eating out.</li>
<li><strong>Consume less</strong> - Not from an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-consumerism">anti-consumerism</a> perspective, but from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource">resource</a> perspective e.g. paper, plastic, water, fossil fuels, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Post more</strong> - Post here more frequently.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise</strong> - At least 4 times a week.</li>
<li><strong>Eat better</strong> - Reinstate my &#8220;don&#8217;t finish your plate&#8221; diet.</li>
<li><strong>Drink more beer</strong> - Not in quantity but variety.</li>
<li><strong>Brew more beer</strong> -  Learn to brew good beer consistently.</li>
<li><strong>Read more</strong> - Catch up on all the books I bought last year.</li>
<li><strong>Adopt a mile</strong> -  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adopt_a_Highway">Adopt a road</a> near my neighborhood.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;ll revisit this list throughout the year and certainly at year-end to see how I&#8217;ve done.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that 2008 is over, its time for a look back&#8230;</p>

<p>On the professional side of my life:</p>

<ul>
<li>In January, I celebrated my five-year year anniversary at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterContinental_Hotels_Group">InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG)</a>.</li>

<li>In November, I began working on a project to replace the legacy customer service application used by IHG&#8217;s call center agents.<br style="font-size: 13.0222px; line-height: 19.0222px;" /></li>
</ul>


<p>On the personal side of my life:</p>

<ul>
<li>In January, I bought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentax_K10D">Pentax K10D</a> DSLR, a purchase I&#8217;ve been wanting to make for a couple years now.</li>
<li>In March, we threw a party <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens,_Georgia"></a>for my cousin who turned 30 years old.  Photos are <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/scotts_30th_birthday_march_2008/">here</a>.</li>
<li>In May, my girlfriend, Rhonda, finished her undergraduate degree in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering">aerospace engineering</a> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology">Georgia Tech</a> and started her first full-time job in the industry.  Photos of the graduation ceremony are <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/rhondas_graduation_may_2008/">here</a>.</li>

<li>In July, I started this blog.</li>
<li>In August, my girlfriend met me in Boston after the Akamai Customer Conference for a much needed vacation.  Photos are <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/blue_jays_vs_red_sox_august_2008/">here</a>, <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/harvard_august_2008/">here</a>, <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/massachusetts_institute_of_technology_august_2008/">here</a>, <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/boston_ma_august_2008/">here</a>, and <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/harpoon_brewery_august_2008/">here</a>.</li>
<li>In September, good friends of ours, Rich and Marilyn, had their first baby, Ian.  Their website is <a href="http://www.dredgefamily.com/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Also in September, a friend and I tried our hand at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrewing">homebrewing</a>.  So far we&#8217;ve brewed an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Ale">English Pale Ale</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_beer">Weizenbier</a>, and an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Pale_Ale">Indian Pale Ale</a>.

<li>In November, I played in my third Bosnian Open, a golf tournament hosted at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candler_Park">Candler Park</a>.  Photos are <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/bosnian-open-november-2008/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>All in all no major life changes this year.  Rhonda graduating and the promotion at work are the most significant events to take place.  I traveled a fair amount, though never as much as I would have liked and I found 2 new hobbies, photography and homebrewing.  Its been a fun year, one that went by way too fast.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to 2009.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever since I got my DSLR earlier this year, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentax_K10D">Pentax K10D</a>, I&#8217;ve been needing a bag for it.  I went without one for a while, wrapping the camera in shirts or towels when taking it places, but that was obviously cumbersome and I was worried the camera would get damaged at some point.  After buying a <a href="http://www.joby.com/products/gorillapod/slrzoom/">Gorillapod</a> and wanting to get a new lens, specifically the <a href="http://www.pentaximaging.com/camera-lenses/smc_PENTAX_FA_50mm_F1.4/">smc PENTAX FA 50mm F1.4 prime</a>, I decided it was time to get a bag to hold everything.</p>

<p>For my birthday, my girlfriend picked out a <a href="http://www.tamrac.com/5256.htm">Tamrac 5256</a> bag from the local <a href="http://www.wolfcamera.com/">Wolf Camera</a>.  The bag was good quality and seemed perfectly fine for holding the camera, however not liking to buy things without researching first and also not liking to buy things at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricks_and_mortar_business">brick &amp; mortar</a> stores when online stores are generally much cheaper, we returned the bag and I began my research.</p>

<p>My main criteria for picking a bag was something that could be used for everyday use and also for travelling, something that could hold my camera, a few lenses, and my laptop, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro">15&#8221; Macbook Pro</a>.  For holding a camera and a laptop, I wanted a bag that had a compartment specific to each, something with padded dividers that could be arranged to fit various cameras and lenses, and also a compartment specific to a laptop.  I read several photography sites, mainly <a href="http://dpreview.com/">Digital Photography Review</a> and <a href="http://pentaxforums.com/">PentaxForums.com</a>, looking for bag reviews.  <a href="http://www.lowepro.com/">Lowepro</a> was a name that came up often, also <a href="http://www.crumplerbags.com/lite/english/products.html">Crumpler</a>, <a href="http://www.tamrac.com/">Tamrac</a>, and to a lesser extent <a href="http://kata-bags.com/">Kata</a>.</p>

<p>I looked at Crumpler first, given the more modern styling of their bags over Lowerpro and Tamrac.  The bags look really nice, seem very clever in their compartments and features, and are highly recommended all over the internet.  I especially liked the <a href="http://www.crumplerbags.com/Lite/English/Products/Whickey-and-Cox-WC03A.html?image=1">Whickey and Cox bag</a>, despite the weird name, however I couldn&#8217;t justify the high price of the bag.  Even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crumpler-Wickey-Laptop-Backpack-Screens/dp/B000U86OR0/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=photo&amp;qid=1230574828&amp;sr=1-3">at Amazon</a> (though sold by <a href="http://www.adorama.com/">Adorama Camera</a>), the bag was $176.   In addition, Crumpler has an absolutely horrible website which just out of principle made me not want to buy anything from them.  I linked to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> version of their site above just to save everyone from its awfulness.</p>

<p>After giving up on Crumpler, I started looking at Lowepro.  Their &#8220;sling&#8221; bags really piqued my interest, specifically the &#8220;slingness&#8221; and the side pocket access for the camera.  The only sling version they make that can hold a laptop is the <a href="http://products.lowepro.com/product/SlingShot-350-AW,2117,4.htm">SlingShot 350 AW</a>.  It looked as though this would make for quick and easy access to the camera, especially while &#8220;on the go.&#8221;  This photo demonstrates it well:</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-339" title="lowepro-slingshot-350aw" src="http://cameronstokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/lowepro-slingshot-350aw.jpeg" alt="Lowepro SlingShot 350 AW" width="136" height="195" /></p>

<p>Having read some positive reviews of the Lowepro bags and liking the  look and features of the bag I thought I had found the bag for me.  It was cheaper than the Crumpler bag, but still expensive at $145 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lowepro-SlingShot-350-AW-Black/dp/B001E07NY6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=photo&amp;qid=1230575840&amp;sr=1-2">from Amazon</a>.   I ordered it anyway and after unpacking it had two immediate thoughts; it was huge and it was ugly.  Thinking I could get past this, I loaded it up with my camera and laptop and tried it on.  I found the sling style of it quite awkward given its size.  It was so big that it was difficult to pull around the side of my body and use the side pocket to get the camera.  This was the main selling point of the bag for me and without this, the SlingShot 350 lost its glamor.  All in all the bag was well made, fit everything I had with room to spare, but I could not get past the size and looks of it.  I decided to send it back and keep looking.</p>

<p>The next bags I looked at were from Kata.  Their website, as well as reviews from PentaxForums.com, led me to the <a href="http://www.kata-bags.com/product.asp?p_Id=401&amp;Version=Photo">DR-467 Digital Rucksack</a>.  This bag was a backpack instead of a sling bag like the Lowepro but fit my original criteria and did not have the utilitarian look of the Lowepro bag.<br style="font-size: 19.5px; line-height: 28.5px;" /></p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-344" title="kata-dr-467-digital-rucksack" src="http://cameronstokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/kata-dr-467-digital-rucksack.jpg" alt="Kata DR-467 Digital Rucksack" width="256" height="275" /></p>

<p>After more reading, I decided to order it, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kata-KT-DR-467-Digital-Rucksack/dp/B000VW6KXS/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1230572516&amp;sr=8-1">again from Amazon</a>.  It ended up being about half the price of the Lowepro which was an unexpected plus.</p>

<p>After a couple days it arrived and while unpacking I knew I could stop looking.  It looks great, feels great, and fits everything I have.  It&#8217;s perfect.  The compartment for the camera actually pulls in and out like a drawer when opened which is really cool (it&#8217;s hard to tell this in the photo above), the laptop compartment is easy to access and the fancy <a href="http://www.kata-bags.com/Uniquefeatures.asp">TST Rib protection</a> seems to protect the laptop well which was definitely a concern of mine. The bag has a large pocket above the camera compartment which could fit several accessories and had a few other smaller pockets for odds and ends.  My Gorillapod fit in the top pocket fine and could also be strapped to the outside if needed.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had the bag for about 5 days now and have already traveled with it.  I packed it the laptop, camera, my new lens, Gorillapod, 2 hardback books, and still had room in the top pocket and camera compartment for more.  It felt great when carrying and everything felt safe and secure. I found myself wearing it out even when I didn&#8217;t need to just because I liked it so much.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll try to post a more detailed review in the future, but for now my search has ended.  I&#8217;m very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a bag for the camera and laptop.  The Kata DR-467 is a great buy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can&#8217;t remember when I first had or heard of <a href="http://www.newbelgium.com/beer/fat-tire">Fat Tire</a>, all I know is its been a rare delicacy in my years as a beer drinker.  Not so anymore, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Belgium_Brewing_Company">New Beligum Brewing Company</a> has finally come to Georgia.</p>

<p>Over the years I&#8217;ve only been been able to have New Belgium beers by importing through friends coming into town or taking trips myself, and that&#8217;s been few and far between.  I went so far as to email the company last year asking when they would be expanding their distribution area.  Not too long after, my prayers were answered as I read on <a href="http://fredsbeerpage.blogspot.com/2009/03/dcnew-horizonssymbiosis.html">Fred&#8217;s Beer Page</a> that New Belgium was on its way and as of this week Fat Tire, <a href="http://www.newbelgium.com/beer/mothership-wit">Mothership Wit</a>, and <a href="http://www.newbelgium.com/beer/1554">1554</a> are now available in 22 oz &#8220;bomber&#8221; bottles.</p>

<p>I picked up a Fat Tire and Mothership Wit on the way home.  I was particular excited about the Mothership Wit as I had never had it before; it did not disappoint.</p>

<p>The special shout-out to Georgia made it that much more special, &#8220;1st (Legal) Distribution Commemorative: Georgia on My Ride.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.terrapinbeer.com/">Terrapin Beer Company</a> recently brewed a special beer for <a href="http://www.tacomac.com/">Taco Mac</a> for their 30th anniversary.  It&#8217;s named <a href="http://www.terrapinbeer.com/beers/20-The-Thirty-Strong"><em>30 Strong</em></a>.  The name needs no explanation once you see the ingredient list and alcohol percentage.  Terrapin had the beer on tap at their 7th anniversary party last month, but unfortunately I didn&#8217;t know about it when I was there so didn&#8217;t get to have any.  When I heard Taco Mac was going to have it yesterday I made sure to be there.  I even called ahead to ask when the keg would be tapped.</p>

<p>All in all, it&#8217;s a good beer.  I won&#8217;t pretend to be able to describe or identify the various flavors or subtleties of the beer but it&#8217;s very enjoyable.  Fred, the Beverage Director for Taco Mac (a position I would kill for), describes it as a &#8220;very drinkable, high gravity beer&#8221; over at <a href="http://fredsbeerpage.blogspot.com/2009/05/when-bell-rings-come-out-swigging.html">Fred&#8217;s Beer Page</a>.  Very drinkable is true, my boss joined us at Taco Mac and was surprised when I told him it was high gravity after he had just finished a glass of it.  Given this, I have to say I was expecting more from the beer.  With 30 ingredients I was hoping for a more exotic beer than what I had.  It has nothing on Terrapin&#8217;s <a href="http://www.terrapinbeer.com/beers/13-Volume-3---Gamma-Ray">Gamma Ray</a>, which has found a place in Terrapin&#8217;s <a href="http://www.terrapinbeer.com/beers/2-Monster-Beer-Tour/category">Monster Beer Tour</a>.  This I am excited about.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the description and ingredient list from from Terrapin&#8217;s site:</p>

<blockquote>The Terrapin “30 Strong” is a high gravity (8.8% <span class="caps">ABV</span>) Ale. Brewed with 30 different ingredients and aged on American oak spirals, the “30 Strong” will leave your palate begging for more. This fun little experiment has really opened my eyes to a new style of brewing. I call it kitchen sink brewing! Hope you enjoy! Spike</blockquote>

<p>I like that Spike calls it &#8220;kitchen sink brewing.&#8221;  It reminds me of my &#8220;pantry stew&#8221; which is basically whatever beans, veggies, spices, etc. that I can find in the pantry all tossed together indiscriminately.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in 2005, I took an <em>Applications Development</em> class at <a href="http://www.spsu.edu/">Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU)</a> while working towards my Bachelor&#8217;s of Science in Information Technology (BSIT).  At the time the class was taught with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a> (they&#8217;ve since switched to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a> unfortunately) and having worked in Java at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_Hotels_Group">InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG)</a> for a few years already I convinced the professor to let me skip the classes, show up for the exams, and work on the class project at my leisure.  The class project was to develop a computer simulation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis">osmosis</a>.  This is what I put together:</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-617" title="osmosis-simulation-in-java" src="http://cameronstokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/java-osmosis.png" alt="Osmosis" width="553" height="270" /></p>

<p>I wrote the application using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Window_Toolkit">AWT</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)">Swing</a> and allowed the user to vary the size and number of molecules and the number of pores in the center membrane.  Upon hitting <em>Start</em> the molecules would start bouncing around the pane and pass through the membrane thus demonstrating osmosis.  For extra credit I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization">internationalized</a> the application with resource bundles for English and Spanish.  The teacher really got a kick out of that as I remember and I ended up getting an A in the class.  Looking back, the code doesn&#8217;t look too bad, though I&#8217;m sure there are better practices and design for Swing applications.  My forte has always been web applications.</p>

<p>Click <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/misc/projects/osmosis/osmosis.jnlp">here</a> for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Web_Start">Java Web Start</a> shortcut to try out the application.  You can download the full source code <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/misc/projects/osmosis/osmosis.tar.gz">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m wrapping up my trip to Salt Lake City and about to check out of the <a href="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/hi/1/en/hotel/slcff">Holiday Inn Salt Lake City - Airport West</a>, a great hotel currently going through the <a href="http://relaunch.holidayinn.com/">Holiday Inn Relaunch</a> initiative.  My boss and I flew out here last Friday to visit one of InterContinental Hotels Group&#8217;s call centers to discuss some of the applications we&#8217;re developing for the agents.</p>

<p>We came a couple days early to get some skiing in beforehand and were lucky enough to get out here on the last weekend of the ski season for almost all of the resorts around Salt Lake.  We went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowbasin">Snowbasin</a> on Saturday and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_City,_Utah">Park City</a> on Sunday.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-610" title="dscf1953" src="http://cameronstokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/dscf1953.jpg" alt="From the lift at Park City" width="480" height="360" /></p>

<p>After skiing Saturday and Sunday we got to work Monday and had two full days of meeting with the local team and observing our call center agents using the applications my team has written and assisting our customers.  I sat with several agents to get their feedback on the applications and see how they perform &#8220;from the trenches.&#8221;</p>

<p>Highlights of the trip:</p>

<ul>
<li>Seeing the vice-presidential motorcade roll out the back of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-17_Globemaster_III">C-17</a> at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert-St._Louis_International_Airport">St. Louis airport</a>.</li>
<li>Getting a terrible sunburn on my face from the first day skiing at Snowbasin.</li>
<li>Skiing on the last day of the season at Park City.</li>
<li>Using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Sync_Framework">Microsoft Sync</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth">Bluetooth</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_Bold">Blackberry Bold</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora_(music_service)">Pandora</a> in our rental car to stream music to the stereo system.</li>
<li>Visiting two brewpubs in downtown Salt Lake City, <a href="http://www.redrockbrewing.com/">Red Rock Brewing Company</a> and <a href="http://www.squatters.com/">Squatters</a>.</li>
<li>Finding out Utah is now more relaxed about alcohol sales than Georgia.</li>
<li>Using a Windows XP guest inside <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox">VirtualBox</a> to transfer photos from my camera which isn&#8217;t recognized by Mac OS X on my Macbook.</li>
</ul>


<p>It&#8217;s Wednesday morning and I feel like I&#8217;ve already worked a full week; the trip was well worth it.  Photos from the trip are <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/salt-lake-city-april-2009/">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since taking up homebrewing I&#8217;ve brewed 6 beers:</p>

<ol>
<li>English Pale Ale - Crap!</li>
<li>Weizenbier - Crap!</li>
<li>India Pale Ale (IPA) - First drinkable beer.</li>
<li>Brown Ale - Definitely drinkable.</li>
<li>Pale Ale - Definitely drinkable.</li>
<li>Pale Ale - Undetermined, still fermenting.</li>
</ol>


<p>As I mentioned, the first 2 were crap, flavorless crap.  Some of them are still in my kitchen cabinet reveling in their crappiness.  The IPA was the first drinkable beer and was actually quite enjoyable.  It was the first beer I was proud to give out to others and claim as my own.</p>

<p>Since then, each beer has been better and better, but I&#8217;m still not brewing as much as I want; I&#8217;ve done 6 beers in almost as many months.  Brewing 5 gallon beers I don&#8217;t get enough practice and don&#8217;t get enough chance to experiment.  I can&#8217;t drink or give away the beer quick enough.  So with some inspiration from <em><a href="http://www.tedbrews.com/2007/12/brewing-one-gallon-batches.html">Brewing One Gallon Batches</a></em> from <a href="http://www.tedbrews.com/">Ted&#8217;s Homebrew Journal</a> I decided to try a one gallon batch this evening.</p>

<p>I purchased a 4 liter bottle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Rossi_(wine)#Wine_brands">Carlo Rossi</a> Chardonnay to use as a fermenter (found at Kroger, Publix only carried the 3 liter bottles), after a quick trip to Home Depot I had parts for a blow-off hose, and a couple hours later the boil was done and we transferred it to the fermenter.  One fatal flaw in this plan was noting being able to take a gravity reading.  I&#8217;ll pick up a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduated_cylinder">graduated cylinder</a> before doing my next batch.</p>

<p>For the first batch we didn&#8217;t stray too far from a typical recipe; a pale ale made from some light dry malt extract (DME) and U.K. Fuggles hops.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-579" title="one-gallon-homebrew" src="http://cameronstokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/one-gallon-homebrew.jpg" alt="one-gallon-homebrew" width="480" height="443" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited about the opportunities this opens up; more frequent homebrews and more experimental homebrews.  I plan on learning as much as I can about brewing in the coming months.</p>

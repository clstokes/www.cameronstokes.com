  <div class="entry-content"><p>Brewing slowed in recent months but we kicked it back into gear a few weeks ago and now have 2 brews fermenting.  Our first foray back into brewing was a 1 gallon all-Simcoe IPA.  This was our 6th brew and the first using Simcoe hops.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the recipe:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Recipe Type: Extract</li>
    <li>Yeast: Safale S-04</li>
    <li>Batch Size: 1 gallon</li>
    <li>Boil Size: 1.5 gallons</li>
    <li>2.00 lbs light DME</li>
    <li>0.33 lbs Crystal</li>
    <li>0.375 oz Simcoe - 60 min</li>
    <li>0.375 oz Simcoe - 15 min</li>
    <li>0.25 oz Simcoe - 5 min</li>
</ul>


<p>We changed three other steps in the process.  The first was to add the steeping grains once the water reached 150 F instead of starting it in the cold water.  The second change was dumping the malt extract in prior to the water boiling.  This allowed us to control the boil better and not have to worry about boilover as much.  Our last change in the process was to wait until the hot break to add the hops.  This led to a longer boil time but again helped to control the overall boil.</p>

<p>The IPA sat in the primary fermenter for 10 days when we racked it to secondary.  In between the primary and secondary it tasted incredible.  All previous homebrews have been <em>ok</em> but nothing spectacular.  This batch was the first that made me say &#8220;Wow!&#8221;  It&#8217;s been in the secondary for 2 weeks so we&#8217;ll likely bottle it in the next few days.</p>

<p>Two weekends ago we brewed a full 5-gallon wheat beer.  We followed the same new techniques as with the Simcoe IPA but also decided to control the fermentation temperature which we had not done previously.  The fermentation bucket has been sitting in a cooler for 9 days and we&#8217;ve been cycling frozen water bottles every morning and night keeping the temperature between 66 - 70 F.  We&#8217;ll take a gravity reading in the next couple days to monitor fermentation.  The plan is to split the batch and keep half for a straight wheat beer and make a peach wheat out of the other half by racking to secondary and adding 2.5 lbs of fresh Georgia peaches.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited to taste each of these once they&#8217;ve conditioned, particular the IPA and peach wheat.  The next batch will be a stout.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fathers_day">Father&#8217;s Day</a>, we took Rhonda&#8217;s dad out for brunch at <a href="http://www.fadoirishpub.com/atlanta/">Fado&#8217;s Irish Pub</a> in Buckhead.  We had a great meal and after getting back home Rhonda realized she didn&#8217;t have her phone.  We called her phone hoping we would hear it somewhere around the house, called her parents hoping they somehow had it, called her sister hoping the same, and eventually called the restaurant to ask them to look for it; nobody had it.  When trying to think where else it could be Rhonda screamed &#8220;Google Latitude!&#8221;</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-724" title="google-latitude" src="http://cameronstokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/google-latitude.png" alt="Google Latitude" width="356" height="303" /></p>

<p>You see back in February when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Latitude">Google Latitude</a> was released I signed us both up on our Blackberries and shared our locations with each other.  Since then it was mainly used for jokes that we were stalking each other or manually setting my location to random places to see if she would notice.  It soon lost its cool factor but it earned it all back when we pulled up Google Maps on my phone and could see her phone was still at the restaurant as of a couple minutes before.  I&#8217;m not sure what the hostess thought when Rhonda called her back and told her she <em>knew</em> it was there and could prove it, but she hopped in the car and went to pick up her phone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been home from Bonnaroo for over a week now and finally getting around to recap&#8217;ing the trip.  The short version is, it was awesome, for the long version, continue reading.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-717" title="dscf2088" src="http://cameronstokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/dscf2088.jpg" alt="Bonnaroo!" width="480" height="360" /></p>

<p>Last year, we left Wednesday night and got into Bonnaroo around 10:00 PM Wednesday.  While it was great to not have to wait in line we ended up way in the back and had to walk about 20 minutes each time we went to Centeroo and back.  This year we were determined to get a better spot and after some research we decided we would leave Atlanta around 8:00 AM Thursday morning.  We hit the road and reached the line to get into Bonnaroo at about 11:00 AM; we were ten miles out from the gate.  We started to curse our plan after sitting in line for about two hours and not making much progress, but we had invested too much time to try something else.  After four and a half hours we reached the gate and ended up in Pod 10, about a 2 minute walk from Centeroo.  The wait had been worth it.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-708" title="dscf2071" src="http://cameronstokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/dscf2071.jpg" alt="What Stage" width="480" height="360" /></p>

<p>After setting up camp we went in for some shows.  Sometime close to midnight we were in That Tent watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Brown_Band">Zac Brown Band</a> when it began to storm&#8230;bad.  We all packed in under the tent and I thought how nice and dry my poncho must have been back at camp.  The lightning and thunder, along with Zac and crew playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_Went_Down_to_Georgia">The Devil Went Down to Georgia</a>, made for a great show.  Towards the end of the show we received an ominous text message from someone who had already made it back to camp, &#8220;Tent city in shambles.&#8221;  When we got back we found that our truck tent had collapsed and was dumping water directly into one of our sleeping tents.  We propped everything up as best we could and went to bed.  Fortunately my truck bed stayed dry and I had a relatively good night of sleep.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-709" title="dscf2199" src="http://cameronstokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/dscf2199.jpg" alt="Bonnaroo!" width="480" height="360" /></p>

<p>Friday we crawled out of bed one by one and made breakfast: eggs, English muffins, and bacon.  At this point I realized I had forgotten my stereo, which is typically first on my list of things not to forget.  This turned out not as bad as originally thought as we spent less time hanging out at camp this year than in previous.  We took this time to fortify our truck tent.  A little after noon we went into Centeroo to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomez_(band)">Gomez</a> and later wondered around to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaki_king">Kaki King</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic">Galactic</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Fleck">Bela Fleck</a>.  Somehow I managed to miss <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_green">Al Green</a>, but I did get to see a bit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Souls">Cold Souls</a> at the Cinema Tent.  I&#8217;ll refrain from reviewing the movie until I&#8217;ve watched it again, but it just didn&#8217;t do it for me then.  Later that night we saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastie_Boys">Beastie Boys</a>, one of my favorite groups growing up and definitely one of my favorite shows for the weekend, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Byrne">David Byrne</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phish">Phish</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Enemy_(band)">Public Enemy</a>.  I&#8217;ve since listened to some tracks from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Talk_(musician)">Girl Talk</a> and <a href="http://www.prettylightsmusic.com/">Pretty Lights</a>, two electronic groups I missed Friday night, and I&#8217;m really disappointed I missed them.  They&#8217;re just the kind of show that is perfect for late-night Bonnaroo.  Oh well, maybe they&#8217;ll be back next year.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-710" title="dscf2064" src="http://cameronstokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/dscf2064.jpg" alt="Does not, in fact, taste like corn." width="480" height="360" /></p>

<p>Saturday morning started off much like Friday, except we could tell it was going to be a good bit hotter than the previous day.  We skipped the breakfast and went straight for the cold drinks and junk food.  Saturday was also round 2 for <em>Eric vs. the Solar Powered Cell-phone Charger</em>.  It consisted mainly of Eric leaving his phone plugged into the charger for an hour, checking it, playing with the buttons, connection, rinse, repeat; a match that went at least 2 more rounds that weekend.  Ilo and the Coral Reefer Allstars started at noon Saturday, a band I wouldn&#8217;t have gone to see except they announced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Buffet">Jimmy Buffet</a> would be joining them.  Buffet put on a great show as usual.  I forget who we saw after Buffet, but we ended up at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon_Iver">Bon Iver</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gov%27t_Mule">Gov&#8217;t Mule</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_costello">Elvis Costello</a> later in the afternoon.  We listened to Gov&#8217;t Mule from the Broo&#8217;ers Festival where we tried beers from <a href="http://pisgahbrewing.com/">Pisgah Brewing Company</a>, <a href="http://peoplesbrew.com/">People&#8217;s Brewing Company</a>, <a href="http://www.starrhill.com/">Starr Hill Brewery</a>, and my favorites from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetwater_Brewing_Company">SweetWater</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrapin_Beer_Company">Terrapin</a>.  Saturday night we saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen_and_the_E_Street_Band">Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Inch_Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Harper">Ben Harper</a>, and a bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moe.">moe.</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGMT">MGMT</a>.  It was an incredible night, much better than 2008 when we waited until 5:00 AM Sunday morning to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_west">Kanye West</a>.  After the shows I went to the Cinema Tent again to cool off and was treated to another showing of Cold Souls; I could not get away from this movie.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-711" title="dscf2167" src="http://cameronstokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/dscf2167.jpg" alt="Nine Inch Nails" width="480" height="360" /></p>

<p>Sunday we all woke up with grand illusions of sticking around to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg">Snoop Dogg</a> that evening.  Unfortunately we were all hot, exhausted, and ready to go home.  I went into Centeroo to check things out and there was definitely a different mood about the place.  Everyone seemed hot, exhausted, and ready to go home.  I went back to camp and we put it to a vote; &#8220;go home&#8221; won, so we packed up and hit the road.  I didn&#8217;t get to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.A._Bondy">A.A. Bondy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Dennen">Brett Dennen</a>, or Snoop, but I did get to go home and take a shower.  I think I made the right decision.</p>

<p>Some other thoughts regarding the weekend that don&#8217;t lend themselves to paragraph form:</p>

<ul>
<li>This was the first year the festival used drink cups made from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylactic_acid">corn-based plastic</a>; pretty cool.</li>
<li>Anheuser Busch doesn&#8217;t belong anywhere near the Broo&#8217;ers Festival.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weinberg">Max Weinberg</a>&#8217;s son, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Weinberg">Jay Weinberg</a>, is an incredible drummer and only 18 years old.</li>
<li>There were not enough late-night shows Saturday night.  I ran out of steam too early Friday, but was up late Saturday, and ran out of things to do.</li>
<li>Somehow we spent less time hanging out this year.  Previous years we would spent a good bit of time at camp or catching some shade in Centeroo, but this year we were definitely moving around more.  I haven&#8217;t figured out why yet, because I don&#8217;t think we were rushing to shows, but something changed this year.</li>
<li>Last year&#8217;s weather was better, but this year&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t as bad as years prior to 2008.</li>
</ul>


<p>All in all it was a great Bonnaroo and it lived up to its purpose: an escape from work, chores, yard work and the like.  Of course I missed Rhonda and my dogs, but there&#8217;s something enjoyable about just letting loose, being dirty, not caring what time it is, eating crappy, drinking beer too early in the day, and listening to some great music.  I can&#8217;t wait for next year&#8217;s Bonnaroo!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In less than 24 hours I will be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester,_Tennessee">Manchester, TN</a> attending the 2009 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnaroo_Music_Festival">Bonnaroo Music Festival</a>.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-687" title="bonnaroo-2007" src="http://cameronstokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/bonnaroo-2007.jpg" alt="Bonnaroo!" width="480" height="360" /></p>

<p>This will be my 5th consecutive Bonnaroo festival and much like past years, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m looking forward to:</p>

<ul>
* Turning off email to my BlackBerry (already off).
* Not caring what time it is except to make sure I make it to the shows on time.
* Being woken up by the sunrise.
* Marveling at our <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/bonnaroo_june_2007/DSC04407.jpg.php">truck tent</a>.
* Listening to Radio Bonnaroo.
* People watching.
* Truly relaxing.
</ul>


<p>I have a mental list and schedule of the shows I want to see; the highlights are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen_and_the_E_Street_Band">Bruce Springsteen</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Costello"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastie_Boys">Beastie Boys</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Inch_Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg">Snoop Dogg</a>,  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Dennen">Brett Dennen</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Brown_Band">Zac Brown Band</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femi_Kuti">Femi Kuti</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon_Iver">Bon Iver</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.A._Bondy">A.A. Bondy</a>, an eclectic mix for sure.  Despite the headliners, in past years, the best show has always been the one I didn&#8217;t expect.  Last year it was <a href="http://www.soulrebelsbrassband.com/">Soul Rebels Brass Band</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupe_Fiasco">Lupe Fiasco</a> and the year before that it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Nutini">Paolo Nutini</a>; who knows who it will be this year.</p>

<p>Here are photos from past Bonnaroo years: <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/bonnaroo_june_2006/">2006</a>, <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/bonnaroo_june_2007/">2007</a>, and <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/bonnaroo_june_2008/">2008</a>.  I&#8217;ll update with photos from 2009 sometime next week.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After holding out on social networking for a few years now, I&#8217;ve finally signed up for <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>.  I&#8217;m still figuring things out, but so far I&#8217;m most impressed with the site itself.  You can tell the team at Facebook has put a lot of effort into making the site easy to use and giving the site a clean and consistent look; a stark contrast to the cesspool that is <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a> (I never joined MySpace either).</p>

<p>Not much else to say at the moment since I&#8217;ve been using the site for only an hour or so.  My profile is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Cameron-Stokes/100000020865662">here</a>.</p>

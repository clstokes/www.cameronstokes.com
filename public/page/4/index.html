  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>My fiancé Rhonda and I have picked up and moved to Seattle so that she can pursue a job at Boeing working on their 787 Dreamliner. We opted to make the cross-country drive rather than fly. This series of posts will be a recap of our drive. Here&#8217;s our adventure&#8230;</em></p>

<h1>Day 1</h1>

<p>Our first day we left Atlanta heading for St. Louis. The drive through Georgia and most of Tennessee was a familiar one that I&#8217;ve done several times having gone to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnaroo_Music_Festival">Bonnaroo Music Festival</a> in Manchester, TN for the past 6 years. We stopped for lunch in Nashville at <a href="http://www.jacksbarbque.com/">Jack&#8217;s BBQ</a>. Their pork and beef brisket sandwiches are awesome. Jack&#8217;s came highly recommended and lived up to the hype. After lunch we spent the next hour in the Home Depot parking lot jimmy-rigging a tarp across the back of the truck for the impending rain we saw in the forecast. My &#8220;get up and go&#8221; personality was very frustrated by this seemingly waste of time that was eating into our driving time. Once we finally had the right combination of rope, carabiners, and bungee cords we hit the road again. The next few hours were uneventful and we arrived in St. Louis around 7:00 local time.</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/kentucky.jpg" width="480" height="340" title="Kentucky State Line" ></p>

<p>Dinner in St. Louis was spent catching up with our friends Rich and Marilyn who had moved to St. Louis a few years back. We arrived to an open bottle of <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/583/34514">Schlafly Reserve barleywine</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Green_Egg">Big Green Egg</a> heating up. We tied up the dogs to a tree in the backyard and relaxed with Rich and Marilyn and their two sons Ian and Evan. Evan only hung out for an hour or so before his bedtime and Ian stayed up late until about 8:30. We talked about our move, the drive, Seattle, St. Louis and of course&#8230;beer. Rich is an avid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetwater_Brewing_Company">Sweetwater</a> fan so we brought him a case of <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/273/751">Sweetwater&#8217;s staple 420 Pale Ale</a>, and bombers of <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/273/19488">Happy Ending</a> and <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/273/66786">Mean Joe Bean</a>. (Sweetwater doesn&#8217;t distribute to Missouri&#8230;) The Schlafly Reserve barleywine was very tasty, not as hoppy or sweet as some, making it very drinkable. We moved on to lighter fair after that, having my first taste of <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/192/933">New Belgium&#8217;s Blue Paddle pilsner</a> and some <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/583/1629">Schlafly pale ale</a>. Blue Paddle is amazing.</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/schlafly-reserve-barleywine.jpg" width="360" height="480" title="Schlafly Reserve Barleywine" ></p>

<p>In between beers we marveled at the Big Green Egg, discussed grilling and BBQ&#8217;ing, and compared and contrasted Jack&#8217;s BBQ&#8217;s 6 different BBQ sauces. Dinner was chicken wings, pork chops, and kebobs, all delicious. After dinner Ian went to bed, we watched some TV and played with Rich&#8217;s latest toy, a green laser. He learned about it on his recent safari to South Africa where their guide used it to point out stars at night. As soon as we have a permanent address, I&#8217;ll be buying one myself!</p>

<p>We left for the hotel around 10:00 staying in a <a href="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/redirect?path=hd&amp;brandCode=SB&amp;regionCode=1&amp;localeCode=en&amp;hotelCode=STLMO">nearby Staybridge Suites</a>. It was my first stay in an extended stay property and the extra room was enjoyable for the dogs. Unfortunately that night it stormed and the dogs kept us up half the night.</p>

<p>The best sights of the drive were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickajack_Lake">Nickajack Lake</a> just past Chattanooga and the first spotting of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Arch">Gateway Arch</a> in St. Louis.</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/gateway-arch.jpg" width="360" height="480" title="St. Louis Gateway Arch" ></p>

<p>Total driving on day 1 was just over 500 miles  through Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, and Missouri.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ec2-china-response-times-crop.png" width="141" height="100" title="ec2-china-response-times-crop" ></p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been looking at options to improve the performance of our websites in certain regions of the world, specifically China. While there are an infinite number of ways to improve performance a pretty basic one is to reduce the physical distance between users and the website. This means if our users are in China, we need to run our website in China or as close as we can get.</p>

<p>To get a feel for how our website would perform if it was hosted in region I setup a test to compare a U.S. hosted website and an in-region hosted website, in this case in <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services EC2&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2010/04/29/announcing-asia-pacific-singapore-region/">Singapore location</a>. Throwing another hat in the ring, I decided to test the same U.S. website but delivered via <a href="http://www.akamai.com/">Akamai</a>. For those who don&#8217;t know, Akamai has a global <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">content delivery network</a> (CDN) providing accelerated network delivery for static and dynamic content.  This gives us the following test resources:</p>

<ol>
<li>A static resource  served from the East coast of the U.S.</li>
<li>A static resource served from the East coast of the U.S. but delivered by Akamai.</li>
<li>A static resource served from Amazon&#8217;s Asia Pacific region in  Singapore.</li>
</ol>


<p>The resource is the same static 30KB image in each case. Using a monitoring service, I sampled each resource every 5 minutes from Beijing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. The test ran for a little over 3 weeks. Without further ado, here are results&#8230;</p>

<h3>Response Times</h3>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ec2-china-response-times-e1296404574953.png" width="479" height="289" title="ec2-china-response-times" ></p>

<p>Average response times over the 2 weeks  were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Origin - <em>3.49 seconds.</em></li>
<li>Akamai - <em>1.73 seconds.</em></li>
<li>EC2 - <em>0.66 seconds.</em></li>
</ol>


<p>From these numbers you can see how much of an impact distance can have and even more so how much of a positive impact Akamai can have on delivering your content. In this case the physical distance &#8220;as the crow flies&#8221; between the origin and the same content through Akamai is the same but Akamai can greatly increase performance over the &#8220;normal internet&#8221;.</p>

<h3>Availability</h3>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ec2-china-availability-e1296404625651.png" width="478" height="288" title="ec2-china-availability" ></p>

<p>Average availability over the 2 weeks  were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Origin - <em>99.90%</em></li>
<li>Akamai - <em>99.25%</em></li>
<li>EC2 - <em>99.92%</em></li>
</ol>


<p>These numbers might seem low for serving a static image but are typical of what we&#8217;ve seen for China. Akamai&#8217;s availability is surprising as its the lowest of the lot.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The test results certainly support the hypothesis that reducing the distance between a website and its users will result in better performance. This is a function of the &#8220;speed of light problem&#8221; and reducing the number of hops between the two points. Reducing the number of hops would also improve availability by reducing the points of failure in between.</p>

<p>To summarize, no big surprises here, moving your applications and data closer to your customers can substantially improve the performance of your applications. Amazon&#8217;s  availability regions in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific greatly reduce the barrier to deploying your applications globally and making for a better customer experience. This, of course, assumes your applications can be deployed in multiple locations and not impact data or transaction integrity&#8230;this is easier said than done. If you absolutely can&#8217;t move host your applications globally, Akamai can certainly help deliver your website faster. I expect we would see an even better improvement combining Akamai and an in-region hosted application.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><em>Hoptimum</em></strong> is a &#8220;whole-cone imperial IPA&#8221; from Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. From what I can tell this is their first full-release American Double/Imperial IPA. Making it extra special, <em>Hoptimum</em> is brewed with a &#8220;New Proprietary Variety&#8221; hop. As with all of Sierra Nevada&#8217;s brews, they use whole cone hops rather than pellets.</p>

<p>Sierra Nevada has been on a bit of a tear the past couple years, churning  out many new year-round, seasonal, and one-time brews. Their 30th  anniversary seems to have reinvigorated them.</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/sierra-nevada-hoptimum-bottle.jpg" width="411" height="480" title="sierra-nevada-hoptimum-bottle" ></p>

<h2>Beer Facts</h2>

<p><strong>Name</strong>: Hoptimum</p>

<p><strong> Style</strong>: Imperial IPA</p>

<p><strong> Brewery</strong>: Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.</p>

<p><strong> Released</strong>: One-time</p>

<p><strong> Availability</strong>: 24 oz. bottle and draft</p>

<p><strong> From the bottle</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>A  group of hop-heads and publicans challenged our Beer Camp brewers to  push the extremes of whole-cone hop brewing. The result is this: a 100  IBU, whole-cone hurricane of flavor. Simply put —Hoptimum: the biggest  whole-cone IPA we have ever produced. Aggressively hopped, dry-hopped,  AND torpedoed with our exclusive new hop varieties for ultra-intense  flavors and aromas.

Resinous &#8220;new-school&#8221; and exclusive hop  varieties carry the bold and aromatic nose. The flavor follows the aroma  with layers of aggressive hoppiness, featuring notes of grapefruit  rind, rose, lilac, cedar, and tropical fruit—all culminating in a dry  and lasting finish.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Hops</strong>: German Magnum, Simcoe, &#8220;New Proprietary Variety&#8221;, Citra and Chinook</p>

<p><strong>Malts</strong>: Two-row pale, Golden Promise, Munich, and Wheat</p>

<p><strong>Yeast</strong>: &#8220;Ale&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>OG</strong>: 22.8 Plato</p>

<p><strong>FG</strong>: 4.5 Plato</p>

<p><strong>IBUs</strong>: 100</p>

<p><strong>ABV</strong>: 10.4%</p>

<h2>Tasting</h2>

<p><strong>Serving</strong>: From a 24 oz. bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass.</p>

<p><strong>Appearance</strong>: Clear, burnt orange in color. Couple fingers of head but dissipates quickly leaving nice lacing.</p>

<p><strong>Aroma</strong>: Strong hop aroma, but not as &#8220;smelly&#8221; as expected. Resin, pine, and pineapple notes with sweet malt present.</p>

<p><strong>Mouthfeel</strong>: Medium carbonation, perfect for this beer. Syrupy mouthfeel, but not cloying and disappears after each sip.</p>

<p><strong>Taste</strong>: Very hoppy and bitter but balanced by the sweet malt. Slight alcohol after hops and sweetness fade. Citrus and pine from the hops.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p><em>Hoptimum</em> is my favorite kind of IPA/Imperial IPA. It has plenty of hop bitterness but flavor to match as well. What makes it great in my book is that it doesn&#8217;t linger or ruin my palate. It&#8217;s flavor and mouthfeel disappear after each sip, leaving you wanting another. <em>Hoptimum</em> is supposed to be a one-time offering from Sierra Nevada, but as those go they sometimes turn into year-round or seasonal releases. This is one that I hope goes that route, it&#8217;s too good to not brew again,</p>

<p><strong>Food pairings</strong>: A full-flavored soup or stew.</p>

<p><strong>Cellar-able</strong>: No.</p>

<p><strong>Comparable beers</strong>: Port Brewing Hop 15, Russian River Pliny the Elder, Southern Tier 2XIPA.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever since <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html">Google Chrome OS</a> was announced in July of 2009 I&#8217;ve been looking forward to seeing what hits the streets. Fortunately, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome_OS#Cr-48_prototype_hardware">Cr-48 Chrome OS laptop</a> landed on my desk today and I&#8217;ve spent the evening trying it out.</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/cr-48-box.jpg" width="480" height="360" title="cr-48-box" ></p>

<p>Given that the laptop is &#8220;prototype&#8221; hardware I&#8217;ll keep my review to the OS itself. For brevity&#8217;s sake, I&#8217;ll keep this to a stream of consciousness type review:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Initial startup only took a few seconds then after setup of the wireless it took a few minutes to download the OS updates. <em>So far so good.</em></li>
    <li>Once signed in, I&#8217;m taken to a Chrome browser window and a well-designed Get Started page. <em>Meh.</em></li>
    <li>I immediately go to <em>Settings</em> and find not much there. <em>Meh.</em></li>
    <li>Loading my most common tabs everything seems pretty snappy. <em>Good.</em></li>
    <li>I open up my WordPress Admin and start this review, take a photo of the Cr-48 box and wonder how I&#8217;m going to load the photos from my camera. Plugging in the camera (a five-year old Sony DSC-W50) I&#8217;m able to load the photos straight from the mounted disk, though there&#8217;s no easy way to browse and look at multiple photos. <em>Surprised it worked at all.</em></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.picnik.com/">picnik</a> works perfectly on Chrome OS to resize the photo. <em>Cool.</em></li>
    <li>I can&#8217;t figure out how to unmount the camera, so I just unplug it. <em>Boo.</em></li>
    <li>Having opened up about 15 tabs I start to wish I could pull a few out into different windows and alt-tab between them. Never has a favicon been more important. <em>Boo.</em></li>
    <li>All the while, everything is pretty snappy. There&#8217;s a noticeable, but tolerable slowdown when loading multiple pages in the background. <em>Meh.</em></li>
    <li>Page rendering is quick but other page operations such as finding text on a page is slower than normal. Tab switching starts to slow as well. <em>Meh.</em></li>
    <li>After having many tabs open for a while, I can notice Chrome OS start to preserve resources and &#8220;hide&#8221; background pages. The tabs are still there but switching to them triggers the browser to repaint the page. <em>Meh.</em></li>
    <li>Pasting within my blog post cause the page to scroll vertically at times, but not every time. <em>Annoying.</em></li>
    <li>Opening Pandora, Flash is noticeably slower, but is functional. <em>Good (if only for Pandora).</em></li>
    <li>Google Docs is frustrating to use. There&#8217;s a noticeable delay in edits and moving around in spreadsheets and documents. <em>Boo.</em></li>
    <li>There&#8217;s no way to take screenshots within Chrome OS. <em>Boo.</em></li>
    <li>Waking the laptop from sleep is ridiculously fast. <em>Awesome.</em></li>
</ul>


<p>As a software architect that still dabbles in code, Chrome OS certainly can&#8217;t cut it for me. I need a terminal, the ability to install additional &#8220;real&#8221; applications, Java, an IDE, etc. but I expect Chrome OS would suffice for 90% of the population.</p>

<p>From a hardware perspective Cr-48 hardware is definitely a &#8220;prototype&#8221; and detracts from the overall experience. For casual browsing it suffices, but I can&#8217;t see myself using the Cr-48 for long periods of time.</p>

<p>All in all, I&#8217;m impressed and I tend to fling more insults at Google than complements. Given the success of the iPad and the &#8220;limited&#8221; features of Chrome OS, it seems a tablet is a more likely form factor for Chrome OS than a laptop. Microsoft and to a lesser extent Apple should be worried.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The latest service offering from Amazon Web Services is <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">AWS Elastic Beanstalk</a>, allowing companies to deploy applications to Amazon&#8217;s cloud and let Amazon handle deployment and scaling of infrastructure automatically.</p>

<p>From Amazon:</p>

<blockquote>You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring.</blockquote>


<p>While Amazon claims they&#8217;re working on other platforms, initially Beanstalk only supports Java applications deployed in the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat 6</a> container.

<p>For this demo, I used the <em>web.xml</em> and PHP files from Caucho&#8217;s Quercus download and added a <em>phpinfo.php</em> page to show <em>phpinfo()</em> output. Here&#8217;s what our Maven <em>webapp</em> directory structure looks like:</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/maven-webapp.png" width="613" height="280" title="maven-webapp" ></p>

<p>Running <em>mvn package</em> produces a war file that can be deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk without any further modifications. After waiting a few minutes for the EC2 instance to start up, here&#8217;s our <em>phpinfo.php</em> file running on AWS:</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/aws-beanstalk-phpinfo.png" width="765" height="800" title="aws-beanstalk-phpinfo" ></p>

<p>That&#8217;s it&#8230;we have PHP running on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. It could not have been easier. Chances are Amazon will add PHP support down the road but until then you can run your own PHP applications using Quercus.</p>

<p>The full project code can be downloaded on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/clstokes/aws-elastic-beanstalk-php">https://github.com/clstokes/aws-elastic-beanstalk-php</a>.</p>

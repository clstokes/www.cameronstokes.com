  <div class="entry-content"><p>A friend and I decided to take our hand at homebrewing beer.  After doing a bit research we found a local wine making and beer brewing supply shop, <a href="http://winecraftatl.com/">Wine Craft of Atlanta</a>, and decided to venture over and check it out.  The shop owner, Rick Adams (and his wife Peggy whom we haven&#8217;t met yet), was extremely helpful and put up with our countless questions on how homebrewing works, what to buy, what not to buy, etc., and we left with a beer starter equipment kit and an English Pale Ale ingredient kit.  I&#8217;m usually one to buy everything online to save some money, but not knowing exactly what to buy Rick&#8217;s advice was priceless and his prices were roughly the same if not cheaper than the stores online, especially when not having to pay for shipping.</p>

<p>Fast forward a couple weeks, the kit had been sitting idle since we bought it and we finally made time for brewing.  Making the wort took a couple hours, meanwhile our house smelled delicious and reminded me of all my trips to the <a href="http://www.sweetwaterbrew.com/">Sweetwater Brewery</a> (brewery photos are <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/sweetwater_brewery_july_2007/">here</a>).</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/imgp2404-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" title="imgp2404" ></p>

<p>After making and cooling the wort (which required an emergency trip out to pick up ice), everything was moved to the primary fermenter and left to ferment.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_(beer)">initial gravity</a> was 1.041.  After a day of expecting &#8220;vigorous fermenting&#8221; I became worried when our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_lock">airlock</a> didn&#8217;t seem to be doing much.  I emailed Rick asking for help and then realized that we forgot to add water to the airlock.  Rick assured us that everything would be fine we just needed to take a gravity readying to see where we were in the process.  The gravity reading of 1.015 meant everything was on course, and we let it sit for another couple days.  After about 5 total days in the fermenter, and a final reading of 1.015 it was time to bottle.</p>

<p>Bottling began by taking inventory of how many bottles we had collected and realizing we were short (we needed about 2 cases worth).  We grudgingly drank a few more beers, proceeded to sanitize the bottles and equipment, and bottled.  We setup an assembly line of a filler, a passer, and a capper.  We ended up with 40 12 oz. bottles and 3 22 oz. bottles filled with what will hopefully be some delicious English Pale ale.</p>

<p>I hereby name this brew, <em>The First Stab</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was browsing my favorite site <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> the other day and stumbled onto the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_by_revenue">List of corporations by revenue</a></em> article.  I was saddened to see the breakdown of the top 10 companies by industry.  7 out of the top 10 corporations in the world by gross revenue are in the <em>Oil and Gas</em> industry.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Scoble">Robert Scoble</a> wrote a blog posting a few weeks week back entitled <em><a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/08/21/who-should-be-usas-cto/">Who should be USA’s CTO?</a></em> In it he discussed the proposition that America needs a CTO, an idea proposed by Barack Obama (see his Technology Issues page <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/issues/technology/">here</a>), and also who could be up up for the job.</p>

<p>These are the names he posted:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mark Andreessen</li>
<li>Dave Winer</li>
<li>Joel Spolsky</li>
<li>Tantek Celik</li>
<li>Molly Holzschlag</li>
<li>Meg Whitman</li>
<li>Bill Gates</li>
<li>Steve Wozniak</li>
<li>Caterina Fake</li>
</ul>


<p>Some of these I had never heard of (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer">Dave Winer</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantek_Çelik">Tantek Celik</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Holzschlag">Molly Holzchalg</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterina_Fake">Caterina Fake</a>), some of these are ridiculous (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky">Joel Spolsky</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meg_Whitman">Meg Whitman</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>) and some are feasible but still not the right person in my opinion (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">Marc Andreesen</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates">Bill Gates</a>).</p>

<p>Robert obviously picked some of the most popular <em>technology</em> people out there, but they&#8217;re all <em>technology</em> people that run <em>technology</em> companies and that&#8217;s not what America needs in a CTO.  In my opinion we need a CTO from a <em>non-technology company</em>; a CTO from a company like GE or Bank of America or Toyota; someone who helps further their company through the use of technology.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been running my own email server for several years now and the biggest issues have certainly been dealing with spam.  For the longest time I just put up with it and filtered manually.  Then about 2 years ago I put in place an anti-spam gateway using <a href="http://openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> and the excellent guide over at <a href="http://flakshack.com/anti-spam/wiki/index.php">flakshak.com</a>.  This worked great.  I was able to configure the anti-spam settings using <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</a> and tweak to my heart&#8217;s delight.</p>

<p>The biggest issue with this was managing the box(es) running the anti-spam software.  We (I was running a hosting company at the time with two other people.) ended up filling up the various disk partitions with either massive email log files or SpamAssassin data as we added more and more users to the server.  If we didn&#8217;t keep an eye on it, the disk would fill up, and the server would then die in strange ways.  (Fortunately, we were running redundant OpenBSD servers with <a href="http://openbsd.org/faq/pf/index.html">pf</a> and <a href="http://openbsd.org/faq/pf/carp.html">carp</a> so we often didn&#8217;t notice the server had died until we tried to login to it later.)  Anyway, after shutting down the anti-spam servers and moving my personal server I had to figure out another way to deal with the spam.</p>

<p>I ended up using the same email server software as before and setup some forwarding rules following <a href="http://blog.mboffin.com/blogpost.aspx?id=1636">Using Gmail as a Spam Filter</a>.  This worked great as well but sometimes caused a delay in getting emails and given my setup I had to reconcile email in both gmail and my mail server.  That is, marking items as read in my email server didn&#8217;t mark them as read in gmail as well, so I had to do it in both places&#8230;not a big issue but mildly annoying.</p>

<p>Fast forward a year or so and I&#8217;ve now moved my email hosting to <a href="http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/index.html">Google Apps</a> entirely.  The process was a piece of cake though not as fast as I would have liked.  After signing up, you have to prove that you own the domain you&#8217;re wanting them to host, either by uploading an html document that they specify or creating a sub-domain on your DNS server that they specify.  This process seems to take about 30 minutes to an hour for them to verify though they claim it can take 24-48 hours.  After this you have to enable E-mail for your domain which again takes about 30 minuts to an hour as they enable their email servers to accept email for your domain.  Once this is done you just need to change your DNS settings so that your MX records point to Google&#8217;s servers.  The process takes a couple hours, but it&#8217;s mostly waiting.</p>

<p>I left the email server running on my personal server for the next several days so that I could still get email while the DNS changes propagated out to everyone.  About 7 days later I was still getting email to it, but when I checked who was sending it was mostly spam and the number of emails had dropped considerably.  I decided to go ahead and shut it down and not worry about any other email coming in.</p>

<p>All in all, the setup process was painless.  I no longer have to worry about running my own email server or dealing with anti-spam software.  It&#8217;s no wonder why Google provides this, they now gets tons of information about me as they offer ads based on the content of my email.  I may be paranoid, I don&#8217;t like Google knowing so much about me (certainly a topic for a future post), but they&#8217;ve made their services so enticing that it&#8217;s difficult to justify running my own server or paying someone else to do it.</p>

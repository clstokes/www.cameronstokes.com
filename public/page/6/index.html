  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><em>Estate Homegrown Wet Hop Ale</em></strong> is a limited edition release from Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., and as the name implies,  is made with the brewery&#8217;s own homegrown hops and barley. Formerly called Chico Estate the beer was renamed this year as it became the  brewery&#8217;s first certified organic beer. Sierra Nevada is no stranger to environmentally friendly and sustainable practices having one of the country&#8217;s largest privately held solar arrays, CO2 and heat recovery processes, and a rail spur allowing supplies to be brought in by rail rather than truck. As with the brewery&#8217;s other limited releases, especially <em>Life &amp; Limb</em> and the <em>30th Anniversary</em> series, <em>Estate</em> has very intricate and appealing artwork on the label.</p>

<h2>Beer Facts</h2>

<p><strong>Name</strong>: Estate Homegrown Wet Hop Ale</p>

<p><strong>Style</strong>: Wet Hop American IPA</p>

<p><strong>Brewery</strong>: Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.</p>

<p><strong>Released</strong>: October 2010</p>

<p><strong>Availability</strong>: Seasonal in 22oz. bombers and draft.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>Here in the sun-drenched fields of California’s North Valley, the black soil is rich with promise.
In winter, rows of barley seed are laid in the freshly tilled dirt. In spring, trellises are set for hops.

From our fields comes a remarkable homegrown ale, made with organic wet hops and barley grown at our brewery here in Chico and one of the few estate-made ales produced anywhere in the world!

This Estate Ale is rich with the flavors of the valley—featuring hops with earthy, grapefruit-like flavors and layered spicy aromas and barley with mild sweetness and smooth, toasted flavors. Together, these crops grow alongside the brewery to make a truly unique brew.

Enjoy!</blockquote>


<p><strong>Hops</strong>: ???</p>

<p><strong>Malts</strong>: ???</p>

<p><strong>OG</strong>: ???</p>

<p><strong>FG</strong>: ???</p>

<p><strong>IBUs</strong>: ???</p>

<p><strong>ABV</strong>: 6.7%</p>

<h2>Tasting</h2>

<p><strong>Serving</strong>: From a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass.</p>

<p><strong>Appearance</strong>: Frothy, off-white head that dissipates in a couple minutes, but leaves a wall of lacing down the glass. Clear, reddish amber color.</p>

<p><strong>Aroma</strong>: Earthy hop aroma, with lots of pineapple and hints of grapefruit.</p>

<p><strong>Mouthfeel</strong>: Tangy carbonation, medium bodied.</p>

<p><strong>Taste</strong>: Spicy hop flavor but not as much  as expected based on the aroma. Mild malt sweetness.</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sierra-nevada-estate-glass.jpg" width="480" height="321" title="sierra-nevada-estate-glass" ></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p><em>Estate</em> is a very good, easy drinking beer. It has a nice balance of flavors, aroma, and mouthfeel, with nothing overpowering. At over $10 a bottle it&#8217;s a bit expensive, but is good for a yearly special release. <em>Estate</em> is most definitely a Sierra Nevada beer. It has the classic Sierra Nevada flavor that I&#8217;m guessing comes from a house yeast they use. For a wet hop ale, I prefer <a href="../2010/10/28/tasting-terrapin-so-fresh-so-green-green/">Terrapin&#8217;s So Fresh &amp; So Green, Green</a> or last year&#8217;s Sweetwater Dank Tank Wet Dream.</p>

<p><strong>Food pairings</strong>: <em>Estate</em> has a light flavor profile that would  go well with a light flavored meal, perhaps a pasta with a light sauce or a good salad.</p>

<p><strong>Cellar-able</strong>: No, drink fresh.</p>

<p><strong>Comparable beers</strong>: Terrapin So Fresh &amp; So Green, Green, Great Divide Fresh Hop, Sweetwater Border Hopper, Chatoe  Rogue Wet Hop, Founder&#8217;s Harvest Ale.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><em>So Fresh &amp; So Green, Green</em></strong>, Terrapin Beer Co.&#8217;s first wet hop beer, was released this year in between the craft beer industry&#8217;s Oktoberfest, pumpkin, and winter beers. Not coincidentally, the release came shortly after Terrapin&#8217;s Hop Harvest Festival at the brewery in Athens. The beer&#8217;s name is a clever homage to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_Fresh,_So_Clean"><em>So Fresh, So Clean</em></a>, a song from Atlanta&#8217;s own hip-hop duo, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outkast">Outkast</a>.</p>

This is a beer that celebrates the hop! Made with freshly picked,  whole leaf, “wet hops” these off the vine beauties will encourage you to  drink fresh, drink local and drink now!
Drink fresh, drink local and drink now!</blockquote>


<p><strong>Hops</strong>: Fresh &#8220;Wet&#8221; Amarillo Hops  from the Yakima valley</p>

<p><strong>Malts</strong>: 2 Row, Marris Otter, Best Munich,  Honey, Fawcett Crystal</p>

<p><strong>Aroma</strong>: Light hops aroma, a bit grassy and citrus. No malt.</p>

<p><strong>Mouthfeel</strong>: Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is a bit harsh at first but dissipates quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Taste</strong>: Definite green hop flavor, slight pineapple and citrus. Lingering malt flavor.</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/terrapin-so-fresh-glass.jpg" width="480" height="321" title="terrapin-so-fresh-glass" ></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p><em>So Fresh</em> is a great beer. It&#8217;s very drinkable, not being overly bitter or sweet and every sip leaves me ready for another, typical of Terrapin&#8217;s beers. I was surprised when I read the hop bill is all Amarillo. Amarillo is the one hop I can usually pick out because of its  distinctive aroma and flavor, but it&#8217;s very subdued in this beer. This isn&#8217;t the best beer from Terrapin and not the best wet hop beer I&#8217;ve had, but I would certainly buy it again.</p>

<p><strong>Food pairings</strong>: Given the light aroma and flavor, <em>So Fresh</em> would pair well with a light meal. Somehow a fresh salad seems most fitting for this wet hop beer.</p>

<p><strong>Cellar-able</strong>: No, drink fresh.</p>

<p><strong>Comparable beers</strong>: Sierra Nevada Estate Homegrown Ale and Harvest Series, Great Divide Fresh Hop, Chatoe Rogue Wet Hop, Founder&#8217;s Harvest Ale</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Fall, Rhonda and I spent a week in Panama (the country, not the city in Florida). We had an awesome time&#8230;saw the canal, the five-hundred year old ruins of Panama Viejo, shopped in Casco Viejo, got lost driving in Ciudad de Panamá more times than I&#8217;ll openly admit, had many great meals, and spent a couple days at the end of the trip relaxing at Playa Bonita. All in all it was a fantastic trip.</p>

<p>We took tons of photos all of which I promptly (but accidentally) deleted when we returned home. In my defense I had just received an SSD for my laptop and was giddy to install it. In performing backups of all my known data and files I forgot the Panama photos. Fortunately I realized what I had done before doing a full wipe of the old drive or writing much new data to it.
In looking for ways to recover the files I found an application called <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec">PhotoRec</a>, an open source multi-platform application for recovering lost files.</p>

<p>According to the author, Christophe GRENIER, &#8220;PhotoRec ignores the file system and goes after the underlying data, so it will still work even if your media&#8217;s file system has been severely damaged or reformatted.&#8221; Given that, PhotoRec doesn&#8217;t allow you to target specific files or directories, it essentially recovers all files of any given type and dumps them into flat folders. In my case it recovered all JPEG files, including our Panama photos and all other photos on the old drive. A quick bash script helped me find the relevant ones and rename them. It was after I recovered all of them that I told Rhonda what had happened.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a photo of my goofy face I did not want to lose:</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/panama-canal.jpg" width="480" height="321" title="panama-canal" ></p>

<p>The rest of the recovered photos are <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/panama-november-2009/">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3><a href="http://cameronstokes.com/2011/05/14/update-replacement-ups-batteries-and-refurbups-com/"><strong>Update: I no longer recommend RefurbUPS.com.</strong></a></h3>


<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><em>The <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TLDR">tldr</a> version is&#8230;<a href="http://www.refurbups.com/">RefurbUPS.com</a> is awesome and saved me over $80 off buying original manufacturer batteries and over $200 off buying all new UPS units. Read on for the full story.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Several years back I purchased two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply">uninterruptible power supply </a>units (UPS) for my home file-server and firewall. The idea, of course, was to prevent these systems from experiencing temporary power interruptions and potentially causing file corruption in the case of my file-server or just being a nuisance for the firewall. Last year both units died within a month of each other. I couldn&#8217;t believe it&#8230; I was convinced they had a time trigger to fail after X number of years in a ruse to get customers to spend more money. Not wanting to fall for this, I started looking for alternatives.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">A new, comparable UPS would cost approximately $150 (these were high-end models) and I certainly wasn&#8217;t excited about buying two.  Replacement batteries from the manufacturer would have cost approximately $80 each so I was still looking at roughly $160. I looked around at replacement battery sites and was largely unimpressed. Let&#8217;s just say the site design for several sites left me questioning their credibility. I finally found RefurbUPS.com and was sold when I found their instructional video for how to replace the batteries. It wasn&#8217;t a complicated procedure but that gave me the warm, fuzzy feeling I was looking for to buy from them. Total price from RefurbUPS.com including shipping was $90.29 for two sets of batteries.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">After receiving the replacement batteries I installed them and was dismayed when the UPS started beeping and the <em>Replace Battery</em> LED lit after being turned on. I re-installed them a few times with the same results. I watched the instructional video again, realizing it was hard to mess up a two and a half step process, and was stumped. My one thought was maybe the UPS needed to charge a bit. I left the unit plugged in but turned off overnight and when I checked the next day all was well.  The UPS turned on fine, no beeps, and when I hooked it up to my file-server it said it had a full charge.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The UPS have been up and running with the new batteries for a few months now and are holding strong.</span></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My girlfriend (Rhonda) and I recently celebrated an anniversary and she completely outdid herself this year.  Knowing my obsession for beer, she gave me a personalized glassware set complete with pitcher, two pilsner glasses, and two Frankfurt beer mugs.  Here&#8217;s a shot of one of the Frankfurt beer mugs:</p>

<p><a href="http://cameronstokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/home-brewery.jpg"><img src="http://cameronstokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/home-brewery.jpg" alt="" title="My awesome glassware." width="480" height="321" class="size-full wp-image-1033" /></a></p>

<p>Rhonda purchased the set through <a href="http://www.theglassfox.com/">The Glass Fox</a>.  She called them prior to ordering and asked about personalizing beyond the normal options on the site and they were able to accommodate exactly what she wanted.</p>

<p>I highly recommend them and expect to use them again in the future.</p>

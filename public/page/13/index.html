  <div class="entry-content"><p>Despite temperatures dipping into single digits only 2 weeks ago and a supposed 6 more weeks of Winter according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day">Punxsutawney Phil</a>, it really looks and feels like Spring is on the way.  The past week has really warmed up and there is new growth on many of the plants in my yard, even some daylilies peaking out of the ground.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Background</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been needing to upgrade my home fileserver for a while and finally broke down and bought some parts.  Being afraid of losing my data, I decided I&#8217;d move to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSolaris">OpenSolaris</a> so I could take advantage of the extra features <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a> has to keep my bits safe.  One of the first issues I encountered was that the 2 <a href="http://www.promise.com/product/product_detail_eng.asp?product_id=139">Promise SATA300 TX4</a> cards I had in my computer weren&#8217;t supported in OpenSolaris.  After some googling I found that the <a href="http://www.syba.com/Product/Info/Id/34">Syba SD-SATA-4P</a> SATA controller, based on the <a href="http://www.siliconimage.com/products/product.aspx?pid=28">Sil3114 chipset</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Image">Silicon Image</a>, available on <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16815124020">Newegg</a> was supported as long as the non-RAID BIOS was installed on the card.</p>

<h3>The Issue</h3>

<p>After receiving it from Newegg, I fired up the <a href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/hcl/hcts/device_detect.jsp">Sun Device Detection Tool</a> to see if it was reported as supported.  It was not, but having read the reviews on Newegg I knew I needed to install the non-RAID BIOS on the card.  I downloaded the 5.4.0.3 version from the Silicon Imaging site (<a href="http://www.siliconimage.com/support/searchresults.aspx?pid=28&cat=15">download here</a>) and realized I needed either a DOS boot disk or a Windows machine from which I could update it.  Having neither, I pulled out one of the older computers from my closet, installed Windows XP, and proceeded to install the card&#8217;s drivers.  Once that was complete I tried to flash the non-RAID BIOS, but received a pretty nasty error message:</p>

<pre>Flash erase operation failed.</pre>


<p>Given how finicky BIOS updates can be, I was afraid I had bricked the card.  I tried the RAID bios and it flashed without an issue.  I decided to try the first rule in troubleshooting a computer issue, reboot.  After rebooting I was still having the issue, I tried a few more times, read a few more posts online, checked the Syba website which gave me nothing.</p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>

<p>About to give up hope I re-read the readme that came with the download and noticed this line:</p>

<pre>Ensure that a SATA device is plugged into a 3114 SATA port.</pre>


<p>I remember reading the line earlier but brushed it off, figuring that couldn&#8217;t really be required.  Having tried everything else, I shutdown, plugged in a SATA drive, started back up and was able to flash the BIOS without issue.  I ran the Sun Device Detection Tool again and the card was recognized and shown as being supported.  I&#8217;m still curious why there needs to be a drive connected in order to flash the card.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our internet connection at home has been flaking out for the past few days and finally became intolerable today, with over 40% <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_loss">packet loss</a>.  We called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast">Comcast</a> and have a technician scheduled to come out next week.  Usually we&#8217;d get by just fine but Rhonda needed some files from work so she could catch up on a few things over the weeken dso we ventured out to the local <a href="http://www.tacomac.com/">Taco Mac</a> to take advantage of their free wifi.</p>

<p>Turns out their Wifi service is provided by <a href="http://www.wanderingwifi.com/">Wandering Wifi</a>.  The Wandering Wifi service requires you to sign up for an account but Rhonda and I were able to create one account and share it.  The wireless connection seems to drop every 5-10 minutes, I imagine it&#8217;s the microwave being turned on back on the connection.  Out of curiosity I figured out their ISP is <a href="http://www.cbeyond.net/">Cbeyond</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, we got our dose of the internet.  I tried two beers I had never had before; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Brewing_Company">Atlanta Brewing Company&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.atlantabrewing.com/beer_peachtree.html">Peachtree Pale Ale</a> and their <a href="http://www.atlantabrewing.com/beer_blonde.html">Blonde Ale</a>.  For whatever reason I&#8217;ve never had these before even though they&#8217;re brewed in Atlanta (obviously).  They&#8217;re quite tasty, though my local favorite is still all the brews from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetwater_Brewing_Company">Sweetwater Brewing Company</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve hosted a <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/">photo gallery</a> in some form or fashion on my site for about as long as I&#8217;ve had my own domain.  I first used <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/">Gallery</a> and switched to <a href="http://www.zenphoto.org/">zenphoto</a> sometime last year for reasons I can&#8217;t remember now.  Having close to 7,000 photos as of this post I was using up a lot of disk space on my host and was close to running out of available space.  7,000 photos isn&#8217;t an excessive amount but when each full-size photo is roughly 2 MB, it adds up.  I decided the best way to free up space was to resize all of the photos down to the default view size of zenphoto and not allow the full-size versions to be viewed online.  A quick test showed this would reduce the average photo down to about 100 KB, a significant reduction.</p>

<p>Having several thousand photos, I needed to find a way to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing">batch</a> resize them all.  A quick googling found that  <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php"><strong>convert</strong></a> from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageMagick">ImageMagick</a> software suite could do exactly what I needed.  Using <strong>convert</strong>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find"><strong>find</strong></a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs"><strong>xargs</strong></a> I was able to put together a string of commands that found all of my images and converted them to the size I wanted:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>find . -type f | xargs -i convert -size 480x480 {} -resize 480x480 {}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This command finds all regular files under the current working directory and calls <strong>convert</strong> on each file, resizing the photo, and replacing the original file.  Be sure to have a backup of your photos in case you mistype any part of the command.  Since convert is replacing your files you won&#8217;t be able to undo any files that are processed before you stop the command from running.</p>

<p><strong>convert</strong> outputs an error when it encountered video or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">PNG</a> files but kept processing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">JPEGs</a> normally.  I found that when I ran this on images that had already been resized, <strong>convert</strong> wouldn&#8217;t resize them again or if it did the new file wasn&#8217;t affected as the file sizes before and after were the same.</p>

<p>I freed up over 9 GB on my host by running this.  Going forward I&#8217;ll just run this on every new album I upload.</p>

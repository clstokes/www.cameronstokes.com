  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_A_Watt">Kill A Watt</a> awhile back, though technically not a Kill A Watt but a <a href="http://www.seasonicusa.com/power_angel.htm">Seasonic Power Angel</a>, but since I bought it I haven&#8217;t done much with.  I&#8217;ve mainly used it for quick measurements of my computer or monitor, nothing &#8220;scientific.&#8221;  This past week I decided to figure out how much energy was used in my daily coffee-making ritual.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-305" title="Seasonic Power Angel" src="http://cameronstokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/seasonic-power-angel.jpg" alt="Seasonic Power Angel" width="480" height="276" /></p>

<p>I plugged in the Power Angel on a Saturday morning and alternated plugging in my coffee maker (a <a href="http://www.technivorm.com/pages/products-home.html">Technivorm-Moccamaster KBT</a>) and coffee grinder (a <a href="http://www.delonghiusa.com/">Delonghi</a> I can&#8217;t seem to find a link to now) to measure how much energy was used by both.  I made 7 cups (that sounds like a lot but is our usual morning amount) and did the same everyday for the next 7 days.</p>

<p>All in all, the week&#8217;s worth of coffee making consumed 0.56 killowatt hours (kWh) of power.  Given <a href="http://www.psc.state.ga.us/electric/surveys/2008/allprowin08/allprowin08-500.asp">current prices of $0.088 per kWh</a> from <a href="http://www.mariettapower.com/">Marietta Power</a>, this comes out to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=0.088%2A0.56&amp;btnG=Search">$0.04928</a> for the week or roughly <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=0.088%2A0.56%2A52&amp;btnG=Search">$2.56</a> for the entire year.</p>

<p>Not having conducted an observation like this before, I&#8217;m surprised at the results, I was expecting higher numbers.  A nickel a week to make coffee is well worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided to upgrade to <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.7">Wordpress 2.7</a> despite my usual reservations in performing any type of upgrade.  Unfortunately, I was correct in my reservations and had a few issues during the upgrade.  Despite the very manual process of <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress_Extended">performing backups and installing the new version</a> I still ran into some issues that I may have anticipated but nevertheless ran into.</p>

<p>After changing the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php">wp-config.php</a> file for my database I let the Wordpress script make the necessary database changes and then logged into the administration site.  I was quite impressed by the <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/10/the-visual-design-of-27/">new interface</a> but my enthusiasm soon faded when I tried to access my blog and was presented with a very unfriendly blank page.  After reading <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/224460">several different forum posts</a> regarding various reasons for the blank pages experiences after upgrading, I went to the Themes page in the administration portion of the application and saw a message that my current theme wasn&#8217;t supported by 2.7 and that it had been disabled.  I was now back to the default Wordpress theme.  After googling I found that the <a href="http://wpthemes.info/misty-look/">MistyLook</a> theme I had been using didn&#8217;t support the new Wordpress version, at least <a href="http://wprocks.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1602">not yet</a>.</p>

<p>Having the default theme I was able to see that the photos I had uploaded in my previous posts, weren&#8217;t working.  This was easy to fix as I had actually followed the backup instructions above and just copied the <em>uploads</em> folder back into the new install.  The next hiccup I rant into was that all of my plugins had disappeared.  I copied the <em>plugins</em> folder over from my backup, re-activated them and everything seemed fine, except I had to re-enter my site keys for <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-recaptcha/">WP-reCAPTCHA</a>.</p>

<p>Now that everything seemed to be functional, I started looking for a new theme.  I settled on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/big-city">Big City theme</a> which I actually like better than my previous theme.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-285" title="Big City Screenshot" src="http://cameronstokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/big-city-screenshot.png" alt="Big City Theme" width="300" height="225" /></p>

<p>I removed the default logo and would like to eventually replace the skyline rendering with perhaps a rendering of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia">Atlanta</a> skyline.  We&#8217;ll have to see how good my Photoshop skills are.</p>

<p>All in all the upgrade didn&#8217;t go too bad.  I didn&#8217;t lose any data, only spent about an hour on the upgrade and fixing the issues, and am now on the latest and greatest version with a cool new theme.  Some of the issues were probably due to me reading the upgrade instructinos too quickly but the upgrade process could probably be streamlined by the Wordpress developers.  Hopefully I won&#8217;t have to upgrade again for a while.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had a geek crush on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a> for several years now.  Sometimes I find myself just browsing the <a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/">Servers</a> section of their website configuring different servers and imagining what I would do with <a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/coolthreads/t5440/">ridiculous mounts of CPU power</a> or <a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/x64/x4540/">storage</a>.  They make many cool products and technologies that continue to fascinate me:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UltraSPARC_T2">UltraSPARC T2 Processors</a> - Highly scalable, energy efficient processors with Chip-Level Multithreading (CMT).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sun.com/storage/disk_systems/unified_storage/">Unified Storage Systems</a> - Storage systems that scale up to 576 TB.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/highend/m9000/">Enterprise Class Servers</a> - Systems that scale to 256 CPU cores and 2 TB of ram.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/blades/">Modular Blade Systems</a> - Blade systems capable of running SPARC, AMD, and Intel blades all in one blade chassis.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray/">Sun Rays</a> - True thin clients providing low cost, low footprint virtual display clients.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSolaris">OpenSolaris</a> - An open source operating system proving to be a serious contender to Linux.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace">DTrace</a> - An open source dynamic tracing application giving insight into any running process with little overhead.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a> - An open source &#8220;next generation&#8221; filesystem.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a> - An open source, machine independent development platform.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlassFish">GlassFish</a> - An open source Java application server.</li>
</ul>


<p>Given all this, I am amazed at how poorly they do quarter after quarter, year after year.  They bring in over $10 billion a year in revenue but make marginal income and little to no profit.  I don&#8217;t see HP, Dell, IBM, or even Microsoft innovating in all these areas yet they&#8217;re all making money.  So&#8230;what is wrong with Sun?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Microsoft released their latest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live">Xbox Live</a> update today, cleverly named the <em>New Xbox Experience (NXE)</em>.  While I haven&#8217;t had a chance to take a look at all the new features I can speak to the upgrade process.</p>

<p>I turned on my Xbox to play some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_4">Call of Duty 4</a> and was greeted with the friendly update notification.  As with past Xbox Live updates, Microsoft forces you to upgrade or otherwise disconnect from Xbox Live.  While I can understand the technical reasons for Microsoft doing this, its frustrating when all you want to do is play a quick game before fixing dinner.  In any case I chose to upgrade and after about 5 minutes of downloading the Xbox restarted.  I was looking forward to getting to my game when another download launched.  Seeing that this one was expected to take 15 minutes I started fixing dinner.</p>

<p>After this download finished, the Xbox restarted yet again.  When it came back on I was presented with the new Terms &amp; Conditions (T&amp;C) for Xbox Live.  Curious to see how long they were I becan scrolling through them, not bothering to read them.  After 3 minutes of scrolling continuously through something that could rival <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace">War and Peace</a> in length, I reached the end and clicked Accept.  Had I actually read through the Terms and Conditions I would probably still be reading it now 2 hours later.</p>

<p>Once past the T&amp;C I was given the option to choose my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(virtual_reality)">avatar</a> and not wanting to choose one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goober">goobers</a> I was offered I spent the next 10 minutes trying to put together someone that looked like me.  It was truly amazing how many different hair style, color, noses, ears, chins, and clothing options that were available.  I finally found a combination that I was satisfied with.  This part of the process was very <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Nintendo Wii&#8217;ish</a> both in the graphics and sound effects.</p>

<p>After my avatar, I went hunting for the feature I had been waiting for in the new release, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix">Netflix</a> integration.  After finding the link in the Video Marketplace, I had to agree to and start yet another download.  Once that finished I had to activate my account.  This was the first part of the NXE update process I was actually pleased with.  The Xbox gave me an activation ID that I had to take to Netflix&#8217;s website and enter once logged into my account.  I entered the ID, clicked enter, and about 2 seconds later the Xbox was updated and had my 30+ <em>Instant Queue</em> movies available.  This process was very quick and easy.</p>

<p>After all this, dinner was ready and I had to give up on Call of Duty.  I haven&#8217;t actually tried to watch a movie yet so I&#8217;m curious how well that will work but all in all the update process was pretty frustrating.  Given it took about 45 minutes to actually get through all that, I didn&#8217;t have any time for actual gaming.  Maybe tomorrow&#8230;</p>

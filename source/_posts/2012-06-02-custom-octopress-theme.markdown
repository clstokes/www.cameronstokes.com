I switched my blog from Wordpress to Octopress [last October](/2011/10/11/blog-migration-wordpress-to-octopress/) and have been incredibly happy with the change. Aside from how easy Octopress is to use, it allows me to host my blog on [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and not have to worry about Apache, MySQL, backups, security, etc.

While the included theme is attractive, it's always bothered me having the exact same theme as many, many other blogs out on the Internet. I also felt the readability of the included theme could be improved as the text is a bit big and _in your face_.

Anyway, I finally got around to customizing the theme, having borrowed some ideas from various blogs I've stumbled upon over the past few months. Following the [intructions from Octopress](http://octopress.org/docs/theme/), I hacked my way through the CSS and am quite happy with how it turned out.

My customizations can be found in my [custom-theme branch](https://github.com/clstokes/www.cameronstokes.com/commits/custom-theme) on Github. I am by no means a CSS expert so forgive any ugliness or inefficiencies.

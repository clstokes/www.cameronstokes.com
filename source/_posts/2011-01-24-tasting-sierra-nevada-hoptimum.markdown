title: "Tasting: Sierra Nevada Hoptimum"

<strong><em>Hoptimum</em></strong> is a "whole-cone imperial IPA" from Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. From what I can tell this is their first full-release American Double/Imperial IPA. Making it extra special, <em>Hoptimum</em> is brewed with a "New Proprietary Variety" hop. As with all of Sierra Nevada's brews, they use whole cone hops rather than pellets.

Sierra Nevada has been on a bit of a tear the past couple years, churning  out many new year-round, seasonal, and one-time brews. Their 30th  anniversary seems to have reinvigorated them.

<strong> From the bottle</strong>:

<blockquote>A  group of hop-heads and publicans challenged our Beer Camp brewers to  push the extremes of whole-cone hop brewing. The result is this: a 100  IBU, whole-cone hurricane of flavor. Simply put —Hoptimum: the biggest  whole-cone IPA we have ever produced. Aggressively hopped, dry-hopped,  AND torpedoed with our exclusive new hop varieties for ultra-intense  flavors and aromas.

Resinous "new-school" and exclusive hop  varieties carry the bold and aromatic nose. The flavor follows the aroma  with layers of aggressive hoppiness, featuring notes of grapefruit  rind, rose, lilac, cedar, and tropical fruit—all culminating in a dry  and lasting finish.</blockquote>

## Tasting

<strong>Serving</strong>: From a 24 oz. bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass.

<strong>Appearance</strong>: Clear, burnt orange in color. Couple fingers of head but dissipates quickly leaving nice lacing.

<strong>Aroma</strong>: Strong hop aroma, but not as "smelly" as expected. Resin, pine, and pineapple notes with sweet malt present.

<strong>Mouthfeel</strong>: Medium carbonation, perfect for this beer. Syrupy mouthfeel, but not cloying and disappears after each sip.

<strong>Taste</strong>: Very hoppy and bitter but balanced by the sweet malt. Slight alcohol after hops and sweetness fade. Citrus and pine from the hops.

## Conclusion
<em>Hoptimum</em> is my favorite kind of IPA/Imperial IPA. It has plenty of hop bitterness but flavor to match as well. What makes it great in my book is that it doesn't linger or ruin my palate. It's flavor and mouthfeel disappear after each sip, leaving you wanting another. <em>Hoptimum</em> is supposed to be a one-time offering from Sierra Nevada, but as those go they sometimes turn into year-round or seasonal releases. This is one that I hope goes that route, it's too good to not brew again,

<strong>Food pairings</strong>: A full-flavored soup or stew.

<strong>Cellar-able</strong>: No.

<strong>Comparable beers</strong>: Port Brewing Hop 15, Russian River Pliny the Elder, Southern Tier 2XIPA.

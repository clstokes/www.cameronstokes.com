I am excited to announce the initial release of kui!  kui is a modern, browser-based administration tool for Java applications supporting the <span class="mw-redirect">JMX</span> specification.  While tools already exist to monitor Java applications using JMX, kui takes a different approach to cure your JMX woes!

Key features of kui are:

* <strong>Browser-based</strong>: Once installed, all you need is a browser to access your MBeans.
* <strong>Easy-to-use interface</strong>: kui provides a familiar and consistent interface for viewing and administering your MBeans.
* <strong>Standards based</strong>: kui works with a wide variety of application servers and browsers.
* <strong>Pure Java and JavaScript</strong>: kui is written using Java and JavaScript for easy modifications.
* <strong>Open source</strong>: kui is distributed under the New BSD License.

<em>My fianc√© Rhonda and I have picked up and moved to Seattle so that  she can pursue a job at Boeing working on their 787 Dreamliner. We opted  to make the cross-country drive rather than fly. This series of posts  will be a recap of our drive. Here's our adventure...</em>
# Day 5
The next morning I set out early to check the roads for our escape  from Tetonia. The night before at least 6 inches of snow had come down. I  swept off as much snow as I could from the truck and hit the road. As I  turned down Highway 32 for the second time I noticed the sign we had  missed the night before, "TRAVEL AT YOUR OWN RISK". A plow had gone through before I got there and I drove a decent ways down to get a feel for  the drive. Once comfortable I texted Rhonda and told her we were  hitting the road.

Once I picked up Rhonda and the dogs we made our third attempt for Yellowstone. Turning onto Highway 32 again we reminisced about the night before and how much better the roads were. Unfortunately the road had only been cleared a few miles down the road and we hit packed snow and ice again. Not knowing how far the roads would be bad we kept going. A few miles later we passed a plow going the opposite way and the roads were fine the rest of the way to Yellowstone.

We passed through the entrance to Yellowstone around 10:30 AM and made our way toward Old Faithful. On the road to Old Faithful, we saw many Elk and Bison along the side of the road and in the middle of the road in the case of some Bison. Our dogs, Blue and Violet, pitched a fit with every animal we passed. The Bison were easily the largest animals Blue and Violet had ever seen, I only wish I knew what they were thinking. In some cases the Bison were only a few feet from our car.

Old Faithful was about 30 minutes away from erupting when we arrived. We walked the dogs around and tried to stay warm. We were one of 5 people when we first got there and by the time Old Faithful was about to erupt there was a crowd of about 30. I think we were the only 30 people in the park that day. Old Faithful erupted and captured everyone's attention for about 90 seconds, Blue and Violet's included. I had visited Old Faithful once before when I was about 10 years old but couldn't remember how amazing it really was. Water erupting from a hole in the earth is a truly magical site and one that occurs seemingly like clockwork is even more amazing.

After Old Faithful we walked around the geothermal pools for a while and decided to head for the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. We passed many more Bison and even sat in park on the road for about 10 minutes waiting for some to clear from the road. I would have been happy to sit there and watch them except that an RV drove up from the other way and waived a plastic bag out the window and scared them off the road. We found the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, snapped some photos, and made our way for the exit. Being the first week the park was open to visitors, most of the park was actually still closed, so we saw as much as we could.

Yellowstone gave us one last surprise on our way out... a gray wolf!

That night we had reservations in Twin Falls, ID about 4 and a half hours away. We made it in roughly that time on smooth, dry, non-icy roads. It was a welcome change from the night before. We arrived at our La Quinta in Twin Falls and I went out to pick up some dinner. We ate dinner, had a beer or 2, and turned in for the night.

Total driving on day 5 was about 300 miles through Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho.

I'm giving [CLEAR](http://www.clear.com/) Internet a try at home in the hopes that I can replace Comcast with it. The appeal of CLEAR over Comcast is that I can have a portable wifi hotspot with me wherever I go, within CLEAR's coverage of course.

I opted for the [CLEAR Spot Voyager](http://www.clear.com/devices/details/id/devvoyager), but knowing that it had a hard limit of 8 connected devices. At this time, we have 10 network devices in the house so once the Spot arrived I set out to turn our existing wireless router into a wireless bridge. This would save the trouble and expense of adding wifi adapters to our hard-wired devices and get around the 8 device limit as well.

I won't get into step-by-step details on how to setup a wireless bridge. This post is merely to confirm that it is possible with a CLEAR Spot Voyager and an [ASUS RT-N16](http://www.asus.com/Networks/Wireless_Routers/RTN16/) wireless router. I **_was not_** able to get the bridge setup correctly with the ASUS firmware, but I **_was_** able to get it working after flashing it to [DD-WRT](http://www.dd-wrt.com/) and following the [Client Bridge](http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Client_Bridged) instructions.

We now have all wireless and wired devices in the house connected through CLEAR. Look for a future post on my thoughts on CLEAR service as I evaluate it over the next week or so.

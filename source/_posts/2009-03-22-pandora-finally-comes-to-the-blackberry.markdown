<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora_(music_service)">Pandora</a> has finally released a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry">BlackBerry</a> version of their Internet radio player.  While not officially supported on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile">T-Mobile</a> (according to Pandora's website) it installed and works great on my T-Mobile <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_Pearl">BlackBerry 8120</a>.  Just go to <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">www.pandora.com</a> from your phone and click the download link.

The player has worked flawlessly while on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiFi">WiFi</a>, but I have had a few skips while on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Data_Rates_for_GSM_Evolution">EDGE</a>, not enough to make it unusable though.  Song transitions are quick as long as you don't skip.  Skipping songs while using EDGE takes several seconds.  Skipping on WiFi takes only a couple seconds.  For fun I enabled WiFi while a song was playing to see if the application crashed and burned, but my music didn't skip a beat and kept right on playing.  What remains to be seen is how quickly my battery is going to deteriorate due to downloading and playing music all the time.

I have a feeling my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3">Mp3</a> player (also my BlackBerry) is going to take a back seat to this and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM_band">FM</a> radio in my truck will see even less use (except for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Public_Radio">NPR</a>).

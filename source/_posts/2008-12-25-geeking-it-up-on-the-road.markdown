I'm in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?client=opera&amp;q=smithfield,+nc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;z=12&amp;g=smithfield,+nc&amp;iwloc=addr">Smithfield, NC</a> for the next day or so visiting my grandmother for Christmas.  We're in the <a href="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/ex/1/en/hotel/SMANC/welcome">Holiday Inn Express</a> down the road which unfortunately does not have wireless internet even in 2008 even though <a href="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/ex/1/en/hotel/SMANC/amenities">it says it does</a>.  This has not stopped my brother and I from creating our own wireless internet by plugging in his laptop and using Mac OS X's easy Internet Sharing configuration.  I'm now surfing wirelessly and watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(U.S._TV_series)">The Office</a> from my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix#Watch_Instantly">Netflix Watch Instantly</a> queue despite the hotel trying to keep us down.  Oh yea... Merry Christmas!

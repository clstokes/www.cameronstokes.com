A few weeks ago on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fathers_day">Father's Day</a>, we took Rhonda's dad out for brunch at <a href="http://www.fadoirishpub.com/atlanta/">Fado's Irish Pub</a> in Buckhead.  We had a great meal and after getting back home Rhonda realized she didn't have her phone.  We called her phone hoping we would hear it somewhere around the house, called her parents hoping they somehow had it, called her sister hoping the same, and eventually called the restaurant to ask them to look for it; nobody had it.  When trying to think where else it could be Rhonda screamed "Google Latitude!"

You see back in February when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Latitude">Google Latitude</a> was released I signed us both up on our Blackberries and shared our locations with each other.  Since then it was mainly used for jokes that we were stalking each other or manually setting my location to random places to see if she would notice.  It soon lost its cool factor but it earned it all back when we pulled up Google Maps on my phone and could see her phone was still at the restaurant as of a couple minutes before.  I'm not sure what the hostess thought when Rhonda called her back and told her she <em>knew</em> it was there and could prove it, but she hopped in the car and went to pick up her phone.

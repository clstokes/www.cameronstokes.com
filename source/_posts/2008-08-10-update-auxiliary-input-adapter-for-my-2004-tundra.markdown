Disaster!  I plugged my BlackBerry in the other day and the glue around the 3.5MM adapter didn't hold and the plug pushed right through the hole in the dash.  After another trip to Home Depot I picked up some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loctite">Loctite</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanoacrylates">Superglue</a> which seems to be holding strong.

<em><strong>Trailhead ISA</strong></em> from Two Beers Brewing Co. is dubbed an India Style Session Ale but classified an IPA. At 4.8% ABV it doesn’t fit into the strictest standards of a Session Ale but is close nonetheless. It is probably the lowest ABV IPA I’ve had, yet still supplies enough hop flavor and bitterness to be an American IPA rather than an English IPA.

Two Beers recently ventured into canning their beer and Trailhead ISA is one of three initial styles available in cans from them. Per their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150230586597558">press release</a>, Two Beers is the first Washington State craft brewery to introduce 12-ounce cans. Their wording begs the question: which Washington State craft brewery is canning but not in 12-ouncers?

## Tasting

<strong>Serving</strong>: 12-ounce can into a pint glass.

<strong>Appearance</strong>: Slight orange, straw color. Half-inch of frothy head. Lots of lacing leftover. Haze that to fade as it warms.

<strong>Aroma</strong>: Lots of piney hop aroma. Sweet malt comes through as it warms.

<strong>Mouthfeel</strong>: High carbonation, but not over-carbonated. Light mouthfeel.

<strong>Taste</strong>: Very bitter upfront, but dissipates quickly. Grainy malt flavor behind the hops. Very little lingering flavor after each sip.

## Conclusion
I really, really like this beer. While the rest of the beer world is crazy about IPAs I tend to steer clear of them, finding myself drawn to more subtle lagers or complex stouts, Belgians, or sours. Having said that, I think Trailhead ISA is going to become a mainstay in my fridge. It is true to its name, it is a session ale. It is certainly a weak IPA by most standards but is very, very drinkable. On top of that, it comes in cans and I’m a sucker for a good beer in a can. Did I mentioned it's very drinkable? I think I'll have another.

<strong>Food pairings</strong>: BBQs, lighter fare.

<strong>Cellar-able</strong>: Nope.

<strong>Comparable beers</strong>: Johnny Utah Session IPA from Georgetown Brewing, IPA Junior from Red Rock. (Haven’t had either of these.)

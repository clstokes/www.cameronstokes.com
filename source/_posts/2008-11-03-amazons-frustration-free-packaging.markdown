Today, Amazon announced <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200285450">Frustration-Free Packaging</a>, a way of packaging and shipping products in easy-to-open, easy-to-recycle packaging, eliminating unnecessary hard plastic cases and wire ties.

Having cut myself trying to open one of these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blister_pack#Consumer_goods">clamshell</a> packages before (and having to get 3 stiches), I'm excited to see a retailer changing their ways.  The benefits to the environment are obvious as well and surprisingly understated on Amazon's site.  Just in time for the holidays too.

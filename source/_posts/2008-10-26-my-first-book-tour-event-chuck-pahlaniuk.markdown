title: My first book tour event - Chuck Palahniuk
categories: Other
---
I attended my first book tour event a few months ago for the release of my favorite author, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Palahniuk">Chuck Palahniuk's,</a> new book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snuff_(novel)"><em>Snuff</em></a>.  The event was held at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Perimeter_College">Georgia Perimeter College</a> with a packed house of roughly 2,000 people (rough guess based on me counting seats in the auditorium).

The night was a series of hilarious stories and antecdotes from Chuck's experience in story-writing, previous jobs, and life in general. Â I picked up a signed copy of <em>Snuff</em> while there.

Towards the end of the night, Chuck talked about the movie adaptation of his book <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choke_(novel)">Choke</a></em> which was released this past September.  I saw it opening weekend and was reminded again why I like Chuck's books so much.  The movie was very entertaining and very true to the book.  Pay attention to one of the final scenes when Victor is on the airplane.  The man sitting next to him is Chuck himself.

The event was filmed and is available in streaming audio and video formats from the <a href="http://www.pba.org/">Public Broadcasting Atlanta</a> website <a href="http://www.pba.org/afn/event.php?forumEventId=2395">here</a>.  Be forewarned, the book tour, like most of Chuck's books and the film <em>Choke</em>, are not for the faint of heart.

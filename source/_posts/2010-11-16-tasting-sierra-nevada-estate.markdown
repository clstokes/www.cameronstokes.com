<strong><em>Estate Homegrown Wet Hop Ale</em></strong> is a limited edition release from Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., and as the name implies,  is made with the brewery's own homegrown hops and barley. Formerly called Chico Estate the beer was renamed this year as it became the  brewery's first certified organic beer. Sierra Nevada is no stranger to environmentally friendly and sustainable practices having one of the country's largest privately held solar arrays, CO2 and heat recovery processes, and a rail spur allowing supplies to be brought in by rail rather than truck. As with the brewery's other limited releases, especially <em>Life &amp; Limb</em> and the <em>30th Anniversary</em> series, <em>Estate</em> has very intricate and appealing artwork on the label.

## Beer Facts

<strong>Name</strong>: Estate Homegrown Wet Hop Ale

<strong>Style</strong>: Wet Hop American IPA

<strong>Brewery</strong>: Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.

<strong>Released</strong>: October 2010

<strong>Availability</strong>: Seasonal in 22oz. bombers and draft.

<strong>Description</strong>:

<blockquote>Here in the sun-drenched fields of California’s North Valley, the black soil is rich with promise.
In winter, rows of barley seed are laid in the freshly tilled dirt. In spring, trellises are set for hops.

From our fields comes a remarkable homegrown ale, made with organic wet hops and barley grown at our brewery here in Chico and one of the few estate-made ales produced anywhere in the world!

This Estate Ale is rich with the flavors of the valley—featuring hops with earthy, grapefruit-like flavors and layered spicy aromas and barley with mild sweetness and smooth, toasted flavors. Together, these crops grow alongside the brewery to make a truly unique brew.

Enjoy!</blockquote>

## Conclusion

<em>Estate</em> is a very good, easy drinking beer. It has a nice balance of flavors, aroma, and mouthfeel, with nothing overpowering. At over $10 a bottle it's a bit expensive, but is good for a yearly special release. <em>Estate</em> is most definitely a Sierra Nevada beer. It has the classic Sierra Nevada flavor that I'm guessing comes from a house yeast they use. For a wet hop ale, I prefer <a href="../2010/10/28/tasting-terrapin-so-fresh-so-green-green/">Terrapin's So Fresh &amp; So Green, Green</a> or last year's Sweetwater Dank Tank Wet Dream.

<strong>Food pairings</strong>: <em>Estate</em> has a light flavor profile that would  go well with a light flavored meal, perhaps a pasta with a light sauce or a good salad.

<strong>Cellar-able</strong>: No, drink fresh.

<strong>Comparable beers</strong>: Terrapin So Fresh &amp; So Green, Green, Great Divide Fresh Hop, Sweetwater Border Hopper, Chatoe  Rogue Wet Hop, Founder's Harvest Ale.

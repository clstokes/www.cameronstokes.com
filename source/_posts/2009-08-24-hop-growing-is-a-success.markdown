Since planting the hops <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/2009/03/10/bogart-georgia-hop-farm/">back in March</a> we've made numerous trips to Bogart to water, trim, and just overall tend to the hops.  A few of the rhizomes didn't make it but of the 23 vines, we ended up with about 18 that took off and have been growing like crazy ever since.

Based on my research I wasn't expecting the plants to actually produce any hops given they're in their first year but I've been pleasantly surprised by what they've produced.  Since early July we've had 4 pickings and have over 6 ounces of Cascade and Chinook hops vacuum-packed in the freeze.

The best part of growing hops is the smell...they smell incredible.  Being a hop head I can't get enough of the smell and dunked my head into our picking bag several times.  Breaking a hop cone open you can see the lovely lupulin glands and imagine the wonderful beer they will produce.

I'm already thinking to next year about what new varieties to plant and how to expand the hop farm.  All those goes to show you really can grow hops in Georgia.

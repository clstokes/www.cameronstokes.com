<em>My fiancé Rhonda and I have picked up and moved to Seattle so that she can pursue a job at Boeing working on their 787 Dreamliner. We opted to make the cross-country drive rather than fly. This series of posts will be a recap of our drive. Here's our adventure...</em>
# Day 1
Our first day we left Atlanta heading for St. Louis. The drive through Georgia and most of Tennessee was a familiar one that I've done several times having gone to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnaroo_Music_Festival">Bonnaroo Music Festival</a> in Manchester, TN for the past 6 years. We stopped for lunch in Nashville at <a href="http://www.jacksbarbque.com/">Jack's BBQ</a>. Their pork and beef brisket sandwiches are awesome. Jack's came highly recommended and lived up to the hype. After lunch we spent the next hour in the Home Depot parking lot jimmy-rigging a tarp across the back of the truck for the impending rain we saw in the forecast. My "get up and go" personality was very frustrated by this seemingly waste of time that was eating into our driving time. Once we finally had the right combination of rope, carabiners, and bungee cords we hit the road again. The next few hours were uneventful and we arrived in St. Louis around 7:00 local time.

Dinner in St. Louis was spent catching up with our friends Rich and Marilyn who had moved to St. Louis a few years back. We arrived to an open bottle of <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/583/34514">Schlafly Reserve barleywine</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Green_Egg">Big Green Egg</a> heating up. We tied up the dogs to a tree in the backyard and relaxed with Rich and Marilyn and their two sons Ian and Evan. Evan only hung out for an hour or so before his bedtime and Ian stayed up late until about 8:30. We talked about our move, the drive, Seattle, St. Louis and of course...beer. Rich is an avid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetwater_Brewing_Company">Sweetwater</a> fan so we brought him a case of <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/273/751">Sweetwater's staple 420 Pale Ale</a>, and bombers of <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/273/19488">Happy Ending</a> and <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/273/66786">Mean Joe Bean</a>. (Sweetwater doesn't distribute to Missouri...) The Schlafly Reserve barleywine was very tasty, not as hoppy or sweet as some, making it very drinkable. We moved on to lighter fair after that, having my first taste of <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/192/933">New Belgium's Blue Paddle pilsner</a> and some <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/583/1629">Schlafly pale ale</a>. Blue Paddle is amazing.

In between beers we marveled at the Big Green Egg, discussed grilling and BBQ'ing, and compared and contrasted Jack's BBQ's 6 different BBQ sauces. Dinner was chicken wings, pork chops, and kebobs, all delicious. After dinner Ian went to bed, we watched some TV and played with Rich's latest toy, a green laser. He learned about it on his recent safari to South Africa where their guide used it to point out stars at night. As soon as we have a permanent address, I'll be buying one myself!

We left for the hotel around 10:00 staying in a <a href="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/redirect?path=hd&amp;brandCode=SB&amp;regionCode=1&amp;localeCode=en&amp;hotelCode=STLMO">nearby Staybridge Suites</a>. It was my first stay in an extended stay property and the extra room was enjoyable for the dogs. Unfortunately that night it stormed and the dogs kept us up half the night.

The best sights of the drive were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickajack_Lake">Nickajack Lake</a> just past Chattanooga and the first spotting of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Arch">Gateway Arch</a> in St. Louis.

Total driving on day 1 was just over 500 miles  through Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, and Missouri.

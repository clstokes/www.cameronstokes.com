<strong><em>Red Barn Ale</em></strong> is a Saison/Farmhouse spiced with Ginger, Orange Peel, Black Pepper and Grains of Paradise from Port Brewing/Lost Abbey based in San Marcos, California. Port Brewing/Lost Abbey has been around since the mid-90s and made a name for themselves making West-coast style beers under the Port Brewing name and Belgian-inspired and premium beers under Lost Abbey. Even though they've been around for over 15 years, they're a new entrant to the craft beer market in Georgia making available beers under both names.

<strong> From the bottle</strong>:

<blockquote>Off in the distance, a Red Barn hides out content to do nothing more than was asked of it. Another summer day stretches out towards the crisp autumn nights and soon work will begin on another harvest. The barn relaxes knowing full well that each and every season, it will remain unmoved-yet touched by everything nature has to offer. And we're left to wonder, does anyone notice or even care to stop and appreciate the beauty of the Red Barn? We did and so we brewed this lightly spiced farmhouse ale in honor of our favorite season-summer!</blockquote>

## Tasting

<strong>Serving</strong>: From a 750 ml. bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass.

<strong>Appearance</strong>: Slightly opaque and orange in color. A careful pour leaves sediment in the bottom of the bottle. Has a pillowy, lingering head from constant carbonation being released. Clumpy lacing.

<strong>Aroma</strong>: Very effervescent. Spicy with orange zest. Alcohol in background.

<strong>Mouthfeel</strong>: Harsh carbonation at first, but mellows to the right amount. Light body. Any flavor or mouthfeel disappears after each sip.

<strong>Taste</strong>: Dry. Doesn't taste as spicy as it smells. Bitter orange peel with a little ginger and black pepper sting in the back of the throat.

## Conclusion
<em>Red Barn Ale</em> is a refreshing Saison and a great introduction to a new brewery. It doesn't taste as spicy as it smells with a hint of ginger and black pepper but the orange peel is definitely there. I've never had Grains of Paradise so I can't pick out that flavor. <em>Red Barn Ale</em> went great with Thai food.

I'm looking forward to trying other beers from Port Brewing/Lost Abbey.

<strong>Food pairings</strong>: Spicy Thai Food.

<strong>Cellar-able</strong>: Nah...

<strong>Comparable beers</strong>: Saison Dupont and Ommegang Hennepin.

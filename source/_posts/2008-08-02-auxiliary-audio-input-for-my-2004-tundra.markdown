I've been using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_tape_adaptor">cassette tape adapter</a> in my truck for the past few years to hook up my MP3 player, initially an iPod but now my new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_Pearl">BlackBerry 8120</a>.  I've always wanted to install an auxiliary input adapter, and today I've finally done it.

I ordered the <a href="http://www.pie.net/pie_store/shopexd.asp?id=27&amp;bc=no">TOY03-AUX</a> adapter made by <a href="http://www.pie.net/">P.I.E.</a> which I found was known to work with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBL">JBL</a> system in my 2004 Tundra.  I ordered the adapter from <a href="http://www.myradiostore.com/">MyRadioStore</a> and a few cables from <a href="http://www.deepsurplus.com/">DeepSurplus</a> and had all the pieces shipped in by yesterday.

The install took a couple hours as I disassembled the dash and spent a while trying to figure out the best place to install the <a href="http://www.deepsurplus.com/Home-Theater-Audio-Video_2/3-5mm-1-8-to-3-5-18-Adapters/3-5MM-Stereo-Female-to-3-5MM-Stereo-Female-Adapter">3.5MM adapter</a>.  After deciding on a spot I realized I didn't have the right drill bit to drill the hole for the adapter to fit in and took a quick trip to Home Depot.  Once back home I drilled the hole and glued the adapter in using my favorite <a href="http://www.gorillaglue.com/glues/fastcure/index.aspx">Gorilla Glue</a>.

An hour later the adapter is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">inseparable</span> (see <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/2008/08/10/update-auxiliary-input-adapter-for-my-2004-tundra/">update</a>) from the dash, I hook up the P.I.E. adapter and all the cables and am listening to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGMT">MGMT</a> from my BlackBerry.  I should have done this years ago.

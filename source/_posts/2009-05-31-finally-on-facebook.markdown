After holding out on social networking for a few years now, I've finally signed up for <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>.  I'm still figuring things out, but so far I'm most impressed with the site itself.  You can tell the team at Facebook has put a lot of effort into making the site easy to use and giving the site a clean and consistent look; a stark contrast to the cesspool that is <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a> (I never joined MySpace either).

Not much else to say at the moment since I've been using the site for only an hour or so.  My profile is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Cameron-Stokes/100000020865662">here</a>.

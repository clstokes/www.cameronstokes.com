I've started several development/technology projects over the past few years, none of which have made it to a launch or release.  Many of them were to learn new a new framework, a couple were things I thought I could turn into a full-blown product but for whatever reason didn't.

In any case, I have a new project I've been working on for the the past 2 weeks that I plan to see all the way through.  I think there's a real need for a product like this and can see it having a pretty decent adoption.  Without giving away too many details here's a tease:

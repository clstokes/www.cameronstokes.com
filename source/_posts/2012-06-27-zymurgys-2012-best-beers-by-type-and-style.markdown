_Zymurgy_ magazine just released their [2012 Best Beers in America](http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/pages/community/news/show?title=2012-best-beers-in-america) list, based on a yearly poll run by the magazine.

From _Zymurgy_:
> For the past 10 years, we've asked Zymurgy readers to share a list of their 20 favorite beers that are commercially available in the United States. A record number of votes were cast this year: 16,445 for a dizzying array of brands available to beer lovers across the country.

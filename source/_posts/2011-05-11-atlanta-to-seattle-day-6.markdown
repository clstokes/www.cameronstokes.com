<em>My fianc√© Rhonda and I have picked up and moved to Seattle so that   she can pursue a job at Boeing working on their 787 Dreamliner. We  opted  to make the cross-country drive rather than fly. This series of  posts  will be a recap of our drive. Here's our adventure...</em>
# Day 6
Day 6 was our last and final day of driving cross-country from Atlanta to Seattle. It was our longest day of driving of the entire trip (well the longest <em>planned</em> day). We were leaving Twin Falls, ID for Seattle, over 600 miles and supposed to take over 10 hours.

We left the hotel around 8:30 AM, gassed up the truck, and hit the road. Rhonda had looked up the story behind Twin Falls before we left and read that the falls were actually worth seeing. I made a deal with her that if they were within 5 miles of our hotel we would take the detour to go see them. It turns out Shoshone Falls was only 4.7 miles away. It turns out Shoshone Falls is actually taller than Niagara Falls, interesting because Rhonda and I had visited Niagara about 6 months earlier.

After Shoshone Falls we made our away across the Perinne Bridge across the Snake River Canyon and were surprised to see someone jump off the bridge!

I read after the fact that just down from this bridge, Evel Knievel unsuccessfully tried to jump the Snake River Canyon on a motorcycle (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evel_Knievel#Snake_River_Canyon">Wikipedia</a>).

After the excitement of the falls and the BASE jumpers, the rest of the drive was pretty boring. The next notable bit of scenery came as we passed into Washington and saw hops fields on our way into Yakima Valley.

As we finished the drive into Seattle our excitement began to build as we thought of the coming weeks and months as we settled into our new home. Washington seemed to be the most beautiful stretch of the drive since we left Atlanta, undoubtedly influenced by our excitement. As we arrived in Seattle, the sun was shining and there was barely a cloud in the sky. We took it as a sign of things to come.

Total driving on our last day was over 600 miles and right around 10 hours.

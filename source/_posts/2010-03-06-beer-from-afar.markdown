I'm a beer lover.  I don't hide it, I don't deny it, I think and talk way too much about beer.  The other night I had a dream that our Scotch ale (currently in the fermenter) turned out to be the best beer ever.  One of the many  upsides to this obsession is that friends and family know how much I love beer and help feed my obsession.  Case in point...just this week I received two special deliveries!

The first delivery was from a friend who just returned from  California.

From left to right: Brew Free or Die IPA from <a href="http://www.21st-amendment.com/">21st Amendment Brewery</a>, Hitachino Nest White Ale and Hitachino Nest Red Rice Ale from <a href="http://www.kodawari.cc/">Kiuchi Brewery</a>, and Pliny the Elder from <a href="http://www.russianriverbrewing.com/">Russian River Brewing Company</a>.

The next delivery came by way of my Grandmother from North Carolina.  There's a great little beer store in her town and she's recently started going and asking the owner about beers that I might like.

From left to right again: Fourteen Ale from <a href="http://www.weyerbacher.com/">Wyerbacher</a>, Celebrator Doppelbock from <a href="http://www.ayinger.de/">Ayinger Bier</a>, Dragon's Milk from <a href="http://www.newhollandbrew.com/">New Holland Brewing Company</a>, Urthel Samaranth from <a href="http://www.urthel.com/">De Leyerth Brouwerijen</a>, and Samichlaus from <a href="http://www.schloss-eggenberg.at/de/">Castle Brewery Eggenberg</a>.

Some of these I  could likely find in Georgia but don't think I've seen any of them before.  I'm fairly certain I could find the Hitachino Nest beers locally but I  know for a fact 21st Amendment and Russian River do not distribute to  Georgia, though <a href="http://www.atlantabeermaster.com/?p=976">I hear</a> 21st  Amendment will be starting soon.  I can't wait to try each of these beers but am most excited about Dragon's Milk, Pliny the Elder, and Fourteen Ale.

In other beer news, I've posted photos of the <a href="http://www.premiereventslive.com/winterbeercarnival/">Winter Beer Carnival</a> Rhonda and I attended last weekend; it was a blast!  Photos are <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/winter-beer-carnival-february-2010/">here</a>.

My girlfriend (Rhonda) and I recently celebrated an anniversary and she completely outdid herself this year.  Knowing my obsession for beer, she gave me a personalized glassware set complete with pitcher, two pilsner glasses, and two Frankfurt beer mugs.  Here's a shot of one of the Frankfurt beer mugs:

Rhonda purchased the set through <a href="http://www.theglassfox.com/">The Glass Fox</a>.  She called them prior to ordering and asked about personalizing beyond the normal options on the site and they were able to accommodate exactly what she wanted.

I highly recommend them and expect to use them again in the future.

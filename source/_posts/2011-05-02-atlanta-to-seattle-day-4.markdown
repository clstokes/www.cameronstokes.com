<em>My fiancé Rhonda and I have picked up and moved to Seattle so that she can pursue a job at Boeing working on their 787 Dreamliner. We opted to make the cross-country drive rather than fly. This series of posts will be a recap of our drive. Here's our adventure...</em>
# Day 4
Day 4 we left Fort Collins, CO with our eyes set for West Yellowstone, MO driving through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Wyoming">Jackson, WY</a>. The day started out as any other day, little did we know what we were in for...

The drive to Jackson was uneventful as were the previous 3 days except by the time we arrived in Jackson we realized we had made a crucial error in underestimating the drive. Somehow in the confusion of mapping the drive, booking hotels, planning the move, and so on what we thought was a 7 hour drive to West Yellowstone was really a 7 hour drive to Jackson and West Yellowstone was another 3 hours down the road.

Not having done our research on the weather or Yellowstone, we trekked on to the South entrance of the park through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Teton_National_Park">Grand Teton National Park</a>. We soon learned of our second crucial mistake for the day, though the severity of it would become apparent later. It turns out the South entrance to Yellowstone was not yet open for the season. The snow on the ground should have been our fist clue... Our only option was to go back through Jackson and around the park. We saw as much of Grand Teton National Park as we could (see exhibit a below) and made our way back to Jackson. Almost as soon as we had turned around I spotted two moose (meese?) off the road. We pulled over and snapped a few hundred photos of them. Once we had drawn a crowd of other cars and once the dogs had taken notice of the moose and started to pitch a fit we kept on moving. (As Rhonda would learn the next day in Yellowstone, if you see a car on the side of the road, there's wildlife nearby.)

Back in Jackson we turned onto Highway 22 for West Yellowstone. As with the snow, the "RETURN TO JACKSON WHEN FLASHING" sign should have been a warning of our impending doom. Nevertheless we kept going and soon found our way going through what I now affectionately call Dead Man's Pass. Dead Man's Pass is the stretch of Highway 22 that passes through the Grand Tetons from Jackson  to Idaho. As we climbed the Tetons it began to snow. As it snowed the road became icy. Soon enough we were going about 15 MPH on packed ice and snow. Unfortunately the cars ahead of me decided to slow to a crawl and then to a stop and my truck was unable to get traction again and we were stuck. The late 80's Ford Taurus behind me (one straight out of Christmas Vacation) was stuck as well and the cars behind him just began to pass us. After several futile attempts at getting moving again we slid and backed up enough to get going back down the mountain. Once I found a suitable place to pull over we stopped and collected our thoughts. The Taurus had already turned around for another try. Despite the conditions I convinced Rhonda to let me try one more attempt before giving up and staying in Jackson for the night.

This time I was able to make it all the way up the mountain and down the other side. Had we had to have stopped as before we would have undoubtedly been stuck again but luckily we did not. Our friend in the Taurus was not so lucky as we passed him as he was heading back down the mountain as before. On the Idaho side of the Tetons the roads cleared up again and I thought we were home free. We passed <a href="http://www.grandtetonbrewing.com/">Grand Teton Brewing Company</a> in Victor, ID (of which I'll posting a review of their  Sheep Eater Scotch Ale soon) and once through Tetonia we turned onto Highway 32 for West Yellowstone. It was about 7:30 PM at this point and I was anxious to get to our hotel. Unfortunately it began to snow again. After about 2 miles or so I was following an invisible car's snow tracks in front of me and after a couple more miles the only thing visible was the enormous snow flakes that were about 5 feet in front of the truck. At this point we turned around and followed my own tracks back to Tetonia.

Back in Tetonia we called the few hotels in town and finally found one that was open and allowed pets. Rhonda asked if they had a Boeing rate and I chuckled as if anyone from Boeing had ever passed through Tetonia enough to have negotiated a corporate rate.

Once in the Teton Mountain View Lodge we realized it was after 9:00 PM and we were hungry. I left Rhonda, Blue, and Violet at the hotel in search of food. Tetonia, population 247, only has a few restaurants and bars and this night only one bar was open. Walking into Dave's Pub I got quite a few looks from the locals as I approached the bar. I asked the bartender if her kitchen was still open and she said all they had was pizza. I ordered the supreme and watched as pulled a DiGiorno pizza out of the freeze and tossed it into the oven. I ordered a Bud Light in an attempt to fit in and the fellow next to me introduced himself. His name was Jim and said "my daddy always told me to make friends with the biggest man in the bar." (I'm 6'4".) I told him our story and turned down his many offers of tequila as I waited for my DiGiorno to finish. I felt validated in my need to turn around and give up for the night as more locals came through the down exclaiming "it's coming down out there" in much more colorful language. Jim informed me the snow wasn't normal for this late of April and as my pizza finished he wished me good luck on my drive back to the hotel. We ate our pizza, finished our growler of Blue Paddle, and called it a night.

__*Ankle-Buster Ale*__ is a Belgian-Style Pale Ale by [Pelican Pub & Brewery](http://www.yourlittlebeachtown.com/pelican) in [Pacific City, Oregon](https://local.google.com/maps?q=Pacific+City,+OR&hl=en&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=33.077336,67.5&t=m&hnear=Pacific+City,+Tillamook,+Oregon&z=12). Ankle-Buster comes in an attractive, silk-screened bomber bottle like the rest of Pelican's beers. It's a nice, classic look that matches Pelican's "classic" approach to beers.

Pelican is a well-decorated brewery, having won 34 awards through the years at [The Great American Beer Festival](http://www.greatamericanbeerfestival.com/) alone. They make a wide range of very approachable beer styles such as a cream ale, foreign stout, ESB, and more and have one of the best brewery websites I've found. You can even buy their beers online in their [online store](http://www.yourlittlebeachtown.com/store) and of course they have glassware, shirts, and more.

## Conclusion

While Ankle-Buster Ale isn't a beer to write home about, it is a well-made, clean beer if a bit light on the palate. It's very drinkable and leaves you wanting more. Given the opportunity I'd like to have this on draft but I'm not likely to pick up another bomber of it, unless I was really in the mood for a Belgian Pale.

Being relatively new to the Pacific-Northwest, Pelican is one of my favorite breweries in the region. Their beers are very drinkable and by the recent trend of "extreme beers", very normal and normal is great in my book. 

**Food pairings**: Something light - a salad, sandwich, etc.

**Cellar-able**: Nah...

**Comparable beers**: Devotion Ale by The Lost Abbey, BPA by Brewery Ommegang, Demolition by Goose Island Beer Co.

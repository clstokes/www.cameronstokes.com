I saw the <a href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/">Google Street View</a> guy over my lunch break the other day.  We pulled up next to him at a stop light and chatted for a couple minutes waiting for the light to turn green.  There was a large computer screen attached to the dash and we could see my truck and my co-worker hanging out the window.  After the light turned green I paced him for about half a mile trying to stay in the shot before having to turn off.  I'll be keeping an eye on the <a href="http://local.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;layer=c&amp;t=h&amp;ll=33.940084,-84.337664&amp;spn=0.020009,0.035019&amp;z=15&amp;cbll=33.931279,-84.337368&amp;panoid=NHyaVEixTFUi3BDjoZs6Ug&amp;cbp=1,93.90581998806431,,0,6.3411924148560015">spot</a> for the next couple months hoping to show up.

<em><strong>Guava Grove</strong></em> is a Belgian-style Saison from Cigar City Brewing (CCB) in Tampa, Florida. Interestingly, CCB got somewhat of a start in Atlanta at the <a href="http://www.classiccitybrew.com/acat09.html">2009 Atlanta Cask Ale Tasting</a> when they took first place with a homebrewed version of their Hunaphu Imperial Stout. Since then, CCB has made quite a name for themselves churning out many surprising and innovative beers.

## Beer Facts

<strong>Name</strong>: Guava Grove

<strong>Style</strong>: Belgian-style Saison

<strong>Brewery</strong>: Cigar City Brewing

<strong>Released</strong>: Seasonal in June/July

<strong>Availability</strong>: Seasonal in 750 ml. bottles and draft

<strong>Description</strong>:

<blockquote>Guava Grove is a Belgian-style ale that sees a secondary fermentation and extended aging on one of Tampa's favored fruits, Guava. The complex flavors imparted by both the Belgian yeast strain and the Guava are unlike anything you are likely to encounter in other beers. The flavor is a complex weave of banana, guava, and tropical fruit with hints of clove. The elegant beer pairs well with fresh fish, mussels, fresh tropical fruits, and earthy cheeses. It also makes a fine accompaniment to Guavaween festivities.</blockquote>

## Conclusion

I've always been impressed by Cigar City's beers and Guava Grove does not disappoint. The beer is not too tart and therefore very refreshing to drink. There is a nice guava flavor but also a lot of apricot and tangerine. On my first sip I was reminded of an orange-tangerine juice.

One of my favorite desserts is a good Flemish or Flanders sour with a bowl of vanilla ice cream to balance the tart. Guava Grove is just shy of being too tart to require something to balance it. It's such a light beer with no alcohol present, I feel I could drink Guava Grove with breakfast.

According to our resident <em>Atlanta Beer Master</em>, <a href="http://atlantabeermaster.com/?p=5297">Cigar City Brewing will be distributing to Georgia in 2011</a>. I can't wait!

<strong>Food pairings</strong>: A light seafood dish, salad, or fruit salad.

<strong>Cellar-able</strong>: Given the flavors and alcohol percentage, Guava Grove would likely not deteriorate over time, but probably would not improve.  <strong> </strong>

<strong>Comparable beers</strong>: Duchesse De Bourgogne and Monk's Caf√© Flemish Sour Red Ale.

Ever since I got my DSLR earlier this year, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentax_K10D">Pentax K10D</a>, I've been needing a bag for it.  I went without one for a while, wrapping the camera in shirts or towels when taking it places, but that was obviously cumbersome and I was worried the camera would get damaged at some point.  After buying a <a href="http://www.joby.com/products/gorillapod/slrzoom/">Gorillapod</a> and wanting to get a new lens, specifically the <a href="http://www.pentaximaging.com/camera-lenses/smc_PENTAX_FA_50mm_F1.4/">smc PENTAX FA 50mm F1.4 prime</a>, I decided it was time to get a bag to hold everything.

For my birthday, my girlfriend picked out a <a href="http://www.tamrac.com/5256.htm">Tamrac 5256</a> bag from the local <a href="http://www.wolfcamera.com/">Wolf Camera</a>.  The bag was good quality and seemed perfectly fine for holding the camera, however not liking to buy things without researching first and also not liking to buy things at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricks_and_mortar_business">brick &amp; mortar</a> stores when online stores are generally much cheaper, we returned the bag and I began my research.

My main criteria for picking a bag was something that could be used for everyday use and also for travelling, something that could hold my camera, a few lenses, and my laptop, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro">15" Macbook Pro</a>.  For holding a camera and a laptop, I wanted a bag that had a compartment specific to each, something with padded dividers that could be arranged to fit various cameras and lenses, and also a compartment specific to a laptop.  I read several photography sites, mainly <a href="http://dpreview.com/">Digital Photography Review</a> and <a href="http://pentaxforums.com/">PentaxForums.com</a>, looking for bag reviews.  <a href="http://www.lowepro.com/">Lowepro</a> was a name that came up often, also <a href="http://www.crumplerbags.com/lite/english/products.html">Crumpler</a>, <a href="http://www.tamrac.com/">Tamrac</a>, and to a lesser extent <a href="http://kata-bags.com/">Kata</a>.

I looked at Crumpler first, given the more modern styling of their bags over Lowerpro and Tamrac.  The bags look really nice, seem very clever in their compartments and features, and are highly recommended all over the internet.  I especially liked the <a href="http://www.crumplerbags.com/Lite/English/Products/Whickey-and-Cox-WC03A.html?image=1">Whickey and Cox bag</a>, despite the weird name, however I couldn't justify the high price of the bag.  Even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crumpler-Wickey-Laptop-Backpack-Screens/dp/B000U86OR0/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=photo&amp;qid=1230574828&amp;sr=1-3">at Amazon</a> (though sold by <a href="http://www.adorama.com/">Adorama Camera</a>), the bag was $176.   In addition, Crumpler has an absolutely horrible website which just out of principle made me not want to buy anything from them.  I linked to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> version of their site above just to save everyone from its awfulness.

After giving up on Crumpler, I started looking at Lowepro.  Their "sling" bags really piqued my interest, specifically the "slingness" and the side pocket access for the camera.  The only sling version they make that can hold a laptop is the <a href="http://products.lowepro.com/product/SlingShot-350-AW,2117,4.htm">SlingShot 350 AW</a>.  It looked as though this would make for quick and easy access to the camera, especially while "on the go."  This photo demonstrates it well:

Having read some positive reviews of the Lowepro bags and liking the  look and features of the bag I thought I had found the bag for me.  It was cheaper than the Crumpler bag, but still expensive at $145 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lowepro-SlingShot-350-AW-Black/dp/B001E07NY6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=photo&amp;qid=1230575840&amp;sr=1-2">from Amazon</a>.   I ordered it anyway and after unpacking it had two immediate thoughts; it was huge and it was ugly.  Thinking I could get past this, I loaded it up with my camera and laptop and tried it on.  I found the sling style of it quite awkward given its size.  It was so big that it was difficult to pull around the side of my body and use the side pocket to get the camera.  This was the main selling point of the bag for me and without this, the SlingShot 350 lost its glamor.  All in all the bag was well made, fit everything I had with room to spare, but I could not get past the size and looks of it.  I decided to send it back and keep looking.

The next bags I looked at were from Kata.  Their website, as well as reviews from PentaxForums.com, led me to the <a href="http://www.kata-bags.com/product.asp?p_Id=401&amp;Version=Photo">DR-467 Digital Rucksack</a>.  This bag was a backpack instead of a sling bag like the Lowepro but fit my original criteria and did not have the utilitarian look of the Lowepro bag.<br style="font-size: 19.5px; line-height: 28.5px;" />

After more reading, I decided to order it, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kata-KT-DR-467-Digital-Rucksack/dp/B000VW6KXS/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1230572516&amp;sr=8-1">again from Amazon</a>.  It ended up being about half the price of the Lowepro which was an unexpected plus.

After a couple days it arrived and while unpacking I knew I could stop looking.  It looks great, feels great, and fits everything I have.  It's perfect.  The compartment for the camera actually pulls in and out like a drawer when opened which is really cool (it's hard to tell this in the photo above), the laptop compartment is easy to access and the fancy <a href="http://www.kata-bags.com/Uniquefeatures.asp">TST Rib protection</a> seems to protect the laptop well which was definitely a concern of mine. The bag has a large pocket above the camera compartment which could fit several accessories and had a few other smaller pockets for odds and ends.  My Gorillapod fit in the top pocket fine and could also be strapped to the outside if needed.

I've had the bag for about 5 days now and have already traveled with it.  I packed it the laptop, camera, my new lens, Gorillapod, 2 hardback books, and still had room in the top pocket and camera compartment for more.  It felt great when carrying and everything felt safe and secure. I found myself wearing it out even when I didn't need to just because I liked it so much.

I'll try to post a more detailed review in the future, but for now my search has ended.  I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a bag for the camera and laptop.  The Kata DR-467 is a great buy.

I've always been a big fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a>; they have a huge selection of products, a great website, and great customer service, not to mention the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/kindle">Kindle</a> is awesome.  My fondness for the company may have reached <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanboy">fanboy</a> level based on my latest interaction with Amazon's customer service.

A few months ago I purchased an Xbox 360 Live subscription card from Amazon to extend my Live subscription and be able to keep watching Netflix movies.  Previously I had purchased the subscription cards on Ebay for a decent discount but decided to go with Amazon as the price was only slightly higher and I had always had a good experience with the company.  I received the card and somewhere between the office, the truck, the kitchen table, and my desk at home the card was lost.  I searched for it several times and eventually gave up.  I was about to purchase another card from Amazon when I thought to email them, explain the situation, and see if they could do anything for me.  I sent the email Sunday evening and received a response the next day that they would ship me a replacement.  Two days later (today), I received the card.

Amazon already had a loyal customer in me, but my loyalty has gone up a notch.

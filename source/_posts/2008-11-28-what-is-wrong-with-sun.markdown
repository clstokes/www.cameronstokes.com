I've had a geek crush on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a> for several years now.  Sometimes I find myself just browsing the <a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/">Servers</a> section of their website configuring different servers and imagining what I would do with <a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/coolthreads/t5440/">ridiculous mounts of CPU power</a> or <a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/x64/x4540/">storage</a>.  They make many cool products and technologies that continue to fascinate me:

* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UltraSPARC_T2">UltraSPARC T2 Processors</a> - Highly scalable, energy efficient processors with Chip-Level Multithreading (CMT).
* <a href="http://www.sun.com/storage/disk_systems/unified_storage/">Unified Storage Systems</a> - Storage systems that scale up to 576 TB.
* <a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/highend/m9000/">Enterprise Class Servers</a> - Systems that scale to 256 CPU cores and 2 TB of ram.
* <a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/blades/">Modular Blade Systems</a> - Blade systems capable of running SPARC, AMD, and Intel blades all in one blade chassis.
* <a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray/">Sun Rays</a> - True thin clients providing low cost, low footprint virtual display clients.
* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSolaris">OpenSolaris</a> - An open source operating system proving to be a serious contender to Linux.
* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace">DTrace</a> - An open source dynamic tracing application giving insight into any running process with little overhead.
* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a> - An open source "next generation" filesystem.
* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a> - An open source, machine independent development platform.
* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlassFish">GlassFish</a> - An open source Java application server.

Given all this, I am amazed at how poorly they do quarter after quarter, year after year.  They bring in over $10 billion a year in revenue but make marginal income and little to no profit.  I don't see HP, Dell, IBM, or even Microsoft innovating in all these areas yet they're all making money.  So...what is wrong with Sun?

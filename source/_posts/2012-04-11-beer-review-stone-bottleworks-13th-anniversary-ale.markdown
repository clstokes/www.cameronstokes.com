Bottleworks is a "specialty beer store" that has a large following in the local craft beer scene in Seattle. It's a small, dark place and at first glance, a bit unwelcoming but you soon get past it when you browse their selection. They get all the latest and greatest beers but also have some vintage beers as well. While browsing you can get a pint at the bar in the back or fill up a growler. All in all, it's a great destination for beer enthusiasts and one I always recommend.

This year is Bottleworks' 13th anniversary and like previous years they had an anniversary ale brewed in their honor. Recent years beers have been brewed by the likes of _New Belgium_ (10th anniversary), _Big Sky Brewing_ (11th anniversary), and _The Bruery_ (12th anniversary). 

Bottleworks 13th Anniversary Ale was brewed by _Stone Brewing_ and released on March 24th, 2012.

## Tasting

**Serving**: 22oz. bomber into a New Belgium snifter.

**Appearance**: Two fingers of tan head that lingers and leaves lots of lacing. Dark but not opaque. Lets light through at the age of the glass.

**Aroma**: Lots of hop aroma. Smoked malts and almost medicinal, band-aid smell.

**Mouthfeel**: Thick and creamy, but not syrupy. Medium carbonation; appropriate for the beer.

**Taste**: Smoke is front and center. Heavy hop presence: flavor and bitterness. The medicinal, band-aid flavor is there as well but not's not overpowering that it's not enjoyable. Alcohol is apparent but not too hot.

## Conclusion

With 13 grains and 13 hops, there's a lot going on in this beer and it's evident in the flavor. It's not unbalanced but seems a bit muddled. I wouldn't call it complex or layered, but complicated. If this was a blind tasting, I probably could have guessed this was a beer from Stone. It seems to have a bit of their house flavor. The beers grows on me as I drink it, but that could be the 11% ABV kicking in.

All in all, I'm glad I tried it and I would certainly recommend it to others. If I recall correctly, it was only $6.99, so it is certainly a deal for an 11% bomber. Given the opportunity to have it again, I'd probably pass for something else, but wouldn't hesitate to share a bottle with a friend. This is a good beer, but not a beer that I would regularly buy.

**Food pairings**: Something hearty. A thick and heavy pasta would go well with this.

**Cellar-able**: The bottle says to age it cellar temperature (55Â° F) but I don't expect age would help except to hide the alcohol a bit.

**Comparable beers**: Stone Arrogant Bastard and Double Bastard.

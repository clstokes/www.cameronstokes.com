title: New Belgium comes to Georgia
categories: Beer

I can't remember when I first had or heard of <a href="http://www.newbelgium.com/beer/fat-tire">Fat Tire</a>, all I know is its been a rare delicacy in my years as a beer drinker.  Not so anymore, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Belgium_Brewing_Company">New Beligum Brewing Company</a> has finally come to Georgia.

Over the years I've only been been able to have New Belgium beers by importing through friends coming into town or taking trips myself, and that's been few and far between.  I went so far as to email the company last year asking when they would be expanding their distribution area.  Not too long after, my prayers were answered as I read on <a href="http://fredsbeerpage.blogspot.com/2009/03/dcnew-horizonssymbiosis.html">Fred's Beer Page</a> that New Belgium was on its way and as of this week Fat Tire, <a href="http://www.newbelgium.com/beer/mothership-wit">Mothership Wit</a>, and <a href="http://www.newbelgium.com/beer/1554">1554</a> are now available in 22 oz "bomber" bottles.

I picked up a Fat Tire and Mothership Wit on the way home.  I was particular excited about the Mothership Wit as I had never had it before; it did not disappoint.

The special shout-out to Georgia made it that much more special, "1st (Legal) Distribution Commemorative: Georgia on My Ride."

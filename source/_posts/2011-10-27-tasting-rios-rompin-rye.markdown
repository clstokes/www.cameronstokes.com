*__Rio's Rompin Rye Beer__* is from Epic Brewing Company in Salt Lake City, Utah. A part of their Exponential Series, Rio's Rompin Rye comes in a 22 oz. bomber bottle with an appealing, high-quality label. 

As a craft beer drinker, my beer memories from Salt Lake City (SLC) have been interesting. My trips to SLC include:

* 1st trip - Bewilderment at required club memberships to enter a bar and government labels on each beer bottle.
* 2nd trip - At just the cusp of my beer obsession, visiting Red Rock Brewing and Squatters.
* 3rd trip - Having a Bohemian Pilsner at the top of one of the ski resorts. Most likely not enjoying it as I had yet to appreciate more classic styles.
* 4th trip - A co-worker putting together a mixed pack of Wasatch and Uinta beers to take back to Atlanta, which I drank all of before leaving town.

Honestly at this point, I think my numbers are off and I'm missing a trip or two. Ironically enough, I probably have more of a beer history in Salt Lake City than any city other than Atlanta.

## Tasting

**Serving**: 22oz. bomber into a pint glass.

**Appearance**: A rough pour only creates a quarter-inch of head that dissipates quickly. Hazy, burnt orange color and oily, viscous lacing.

**Aroma**: Funky yeast is the only aroma just after the pour. After that there's a slight rye presence and earthy hops.

**Mouthfeel**: Low carbonation. Oily and slick mouthfeel.

**Taste**: Very little rye. Some citrus and earthy hops. Surprisingly light on flavor. I suppose I get some lemon. Finishes pretty dry.

## Conclusion
I'm disappointed with this beer. Rye is one of my favorite flavors in a beer and this one isn't _rompin'_ and has very little rye. In fact, it's really light on aroma and flavor on the whole. This is a below-average beer in my book. Not a fan. I received this along with several other Epic Brewing beers from a friend in SLC. I'm hoping the others don't disappoint.

I _am_ a fan of Epic's numbering and brewing log of their Exponential Series available on their website. For each batch in the Exponential Series, Epic notes differences in recipe and outcomes. Each bottle is numbered by batch. I wish more breweries did this.

**Food pairings**: Anything... not much going on here.

**Cellar-able**: No.

**Comparable beers**: By style, Terrapin Rye would be comparable but is a much better beer.

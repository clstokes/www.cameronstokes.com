Now that 2008 is over, its time for a look back...

On the professional side of my life:

* In January, I celebrated my five-year year anniversary at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterContinental_Hotels_Group">InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG)</a>.
* In February, I was promoted to a management position in the call center software development group at IHG.
* In March, I traveled to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines">Philippines</a> to see IHG's latest reservations software in use at 2 of its call centers.

* In August, I traveled to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a> for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akamai_Technologies">Akamai</a> Customer Conference.
* In October, my ex-boss returned to IHG to his previous role and is now my boss again.
* In November, I began working on a project to replace the legacy customer service application used by IHG's call center agents.<br style="font-size: 13.0222px; line-height: 19.0222px;" />

On the personal side of my life:

* In January, I bought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentax_K10D">Pentax K10D</a> DSLR, a purchase I've been wanting to make for a couple years now.
* In March, we threw a party <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens,_Georgia"></a>for my cousin who turned 30 years old.  Photos are <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/scotts_30th_birthday_march_2008/">here</a>.
* In May, my girlfriend, Rhonda, finished her undergraduate degree in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering">aerospace engineering</a> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology">Georgia Tech</a> and started her first full-time job in the industry.  Photos of the graduation ceremony are <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/rhondas_graduation_may_2008/">here</a>.
* In June, I went to the my 4th <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnaroo_Music_Festival">Bonnaroo Music Festival</a>.  Photos are <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/bonnaroo_june_2008/">here</a>.
* In July, I started this blog.
* In August, my girlfriend met me in Boston after the Akamai Customer Conference for a much needed vacation.  Photos are <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/blue_jays_vs_red_sox_august_2008/">here</a>, <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/harvard_august_2008/">here</a>, <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/massachusetts_institute_of_technology_august_2008/">here</a>, <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/boston_ma_august_2008/">here</a>, and <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/harpoon_brewery_august_2008/">here</a>.
* In September, good friends of ours, Rich and Marilyn, had their first baby, Ian.  Their website is <a href="http://www.dredgefamily.com/">here</a>.
* Also in September, a friend and I tried our hand at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrewing">homebrewing</a>.  So far we've brewed an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Ale">English Pale Ale</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_beer">Weizenbier</a>, and an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Pale_Ale">Indian Pale Ale</a>.

* Later in September, I went to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Benefit Concert in Cary, NC.  Photos are <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/rock-and-roll-benefit-concert-september-2008/">here</a>.
* In November, I played in my third Bosnian Open, a golf tournament hosted at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candler_Park">Candler Park</a>.  Photos are <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/bosnian-open-november-2008/">here</a>.

All in all no major life changes this year.  Rhonda graduating and the promotion at work are the most significant events to take place.  I traveled a fair amount, though never as much as I would have liked and I found 2 new hobbies, photography and homebrewing.  Its been a fun year, one that went by way too fast.

I'm looking forward to 2009.

Last month <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobb_County,_Georgia">Cobb County</a> showed off the latest addition to their police force and the beginning of their military arsenal.  The <a href="http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/cobb/stories/2008/10/10/police_tank.html">AJC reports</a> the county recently refurbished a donated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAV-300">L.A.V. 300</a> that was used by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army">U.S. Army</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama">Panama</a> and turned it into a lean, mean crime-fighting machine.

Aside from being fun to drive around scaring fellow drivers on the road, what could the police force possibly need this for?

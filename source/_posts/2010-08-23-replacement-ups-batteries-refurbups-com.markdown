<h3><a href="http://cameronstokes.com/2011/05/14/update-replacement-ups-batteries-and-refurbups-com/"><strong>Update: I no longer recommend RefurbUPS.com.</strong></a></h3>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><em>The <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TLDR">tldr</a> version is...<a href="http://www.refurbups.com/">RefurbUPS.com</a> is awesome and saved me over $80 off buying original manufacturer batteries and over $200 off buying all new UPS units. Read on for the full story.</em></span>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Several years back I purchased two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply">uninterruptible power supply </a>units (UPS) for my home file-server and firewall. The idea, of course, was to prevent these systems from experiencing temporary power interruptions and potentially causing file corruption in the case of my file-server or just being a nuisance for the firewall. Last year both units died within a month of each other. I couldn't believe it... I was convinced they had a time trigger to fail after X number of years in a ruse to get customers to spend more money. Not wanting to fall for this, I started looking for alternatives.</span>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> </span>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">A new, comparable UPS would cost approximately $150 (these were high-end models) and I certainly wasn't excited about buying two.  Replacement batteries from the manufacturer would have cost approximately $80 each so I was still looking at roughly $160. I looked around at replacement battery sites and was largely unimpressed. Let's just say the site design for several sites left me questioning their credibility. I finally found RefurbUPS.com and was sold when I found their instructional video for how to replace the batteries. It wasn't a complicated procedure but that gave me the warm, fuzzy feeling I was looking for to buy from them. Total price from RefurbUPS.com including shipping was $90.29 for two sets of batteries.</span>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">After receiving the replacement batteries I installed them and was dismayed when the UPS started beeping and the <em>Replace Battery</em> LED lit after being turned on. I re-installed them a few times with the same results. I watched the instructional video again, realizing it was hard to mess up a two and a half step process, and was stumped. My one thought was maybe the UPS needed to charge a bit. I left the unit plugged in but turned off overnight and when I checked the next day all was well.  The UPS turned on fine, no beeps, and when I hooked it up to my file-server it said it had a full charge.</span>

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The UPS have been up and running with the new batteries for a few months now and are holding strong.</span>

<strong><em>So Fresh &amp; So Green, Green</em></strong>, Terrapin Beer Co.'s first wet hop beer, was released this year in between the craft beer industry's Oktoberfest, pumpkin, and winter beers. Not coincidentally, the release came shortly after Terrapin's Hop Harvest Festival at the brewery in Athens. The beer's name is a clever homage to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_Fresh,_So_Clean"><em>So Fresh, So Clean</em></a>, a song from Atlanta's own hip-hop duo, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outkast">Outkast</a>.

## Conclusion

<em>So Fresh</em> is a great beer. It's very drinkable, not being overly bitter or sweet and every sip leaves me ready for another, typical of Terrapin's beers. I was surprised when I read the hop bill is all Amarillo. Amarillo is the one hop I can usually pick out because of its  distinctive aroma and flavor, but it's very subdued in this beer. This isn't the best beer from Terrapin and not the best wet hop beer I've had, but I would certainly buy it again.

<strong>Food pairings</strong>: Given the light aroma and flavor, <em>So Fresh</em> would pair well with a light meal. Somehow a fresh salad seems most fitting for this wet hop beer.

<strong>Cellar-able</strong>: No, drink fresh.

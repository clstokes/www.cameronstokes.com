## Beer Facts

<strong>Name</strong>: Sheep Eater Scotch Ale

<strong>Style</strong>: Scotch Ale

<strong>Brewery</strong>: Grand Teton brewing Co.

<strong>Released</strong>: One-time in 2009

<strong>Availability</strong>: 1-liter, flip-top bottles

<strong>Description</strong>:

<blockquote>Sheep Eater Scotch Ale was brewed to showcase the  role of malt in the flavor of beer and brewed in strict adherence to the  Reinheitsgebot, or German Beer Purity Law.

Scotch Ales are some of the world's most  flavorful beers.  Scotland's cold, blustery climate lends itself to the  growing of barley and oats, but not to the production of hops, which are  almost always added sparingly.

The yeast must work at cooler temperatures than  is customary for ales, resulting in maltier, cleaner, less fruity or  estery, beers. The color often comes from black roasted malt, which  imparts some dryness, but because of the lower attenuation and hopping  rates, Scottish ales are almost always slightly sweet and incredibly  drinkable.

Ours was brewed with black roasted barley,  biscuit and peat-smoked malt.  It was gently hopped, fermented cool and  aged cold for weeks for smoothness.  It is copper-brown in color, with  some sweet maltiness and plenty of body.

Try it with ham, roast pork or chicken, roasted  vegetables or venison, cr√®me brulee or, most traditionally, Scottish  butter shortbread cookies.</blockquote>

## Tasting

<strong>Serving</strong>: From a 1-liter, flip-top bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass.

<strong>Appearance</strong>: Pours an opaque, copper brown. One finger of head off the first pour.

<strong>Aroma</strong>: Sweet, roasty, and smokey malt. No discernible hops or alcohol aroma.

<strong>Mouthfeel</strong>: Thick mouthfeel, but not syrupy. Medium to low amount of carbonation, the perfect amount.

<strong>Taste</strong>: Sweet malts, but not cloying. Just the right amount of roasty, smokey malt flavor. Raisins and toffee after taste. Slight alcohol presence.

## Conclusion
For a brewery I've never heard of in the middle of nowhere Idaho, I'm damn impressed. Every aspect of the beer was spot on: the mouthfeel, complexities of flavor, and even carbonation, surprising for a flip-top bottle.

<strong>Food pairings</strong>: A hearty meal. Shepherd's pie, meatloaf, etc.

<strong>Cellar-able</strong>: I would say yes, but Grand Teton's Cellar Master says to drink it now. (<a href="http://grandtetoncellar.blogspot.com/2011/01/sheep-eater-at-one-year.html">Link</a>)<strong> </strong>

<strong>Comparable beers</strong>: Founders Dirty Bastard.

The night we tried Sheep Eater Scotch Ale we paired it with homemade shepherd's pie. It was a perfect combination.

Coincidentally, on our <a href="../2011/04/24/something-new-atlanta-to-seattle/">drive from Atlanta to Seattle in April</a> we drove right by  Grand Teton Brewing Co. in  Victor, ID. Had known this beforehand I would have made sure they were open they were open.  I'm now on the lookout for other Grand Teton beers to try, but unfortunately was told by local beer store that they no longer distribute to Washington. Hopefully this isn't true.

<strong><em>My Antonia</em></strong> was born from a collaboration with Dogfish Head's founder Sam Calgione and Leonardo DiVencenzo of the Italian brewery Birra del Borgo. <em>My Antonia</em> is an imperial pilsner brewed using Dogfish Head's now famous continuous hopping process where hops are introduced throughout the boil rather than at set intervals. The first batch was brewed in Italy with a limited import to The States. In 2010, Dogfish Head brewed their inaugural batch at the Dogfish Head brewery in Delaware. My tasting is from the U.S. version.

## Tasting

<strong>Serving</strong>: From a 750 ml. bottle into a Dogfish Head pint glass.

<strong>Appearance</strong>: Pours hazy with a couple fingers of frothy, off-white head. The head lingers for a long time and leaves a good amount of lacing.

<strong>Aroma</strong>: Has a classic Noble hop, pilsner aroma.

<strong>Mouthfeel</strong>: Initially has a strong carbonation bite that goes away after time and becomes more drinkable. Medium mouthfeel that leaves a cloying stickiness causing a lot of mouthwatering after every sip.

<strong>Taste</strong>: A crisp, clean pilsner flavor. Hoppy for a pilsner, even an imperial pilsner. More hop bitterness than hop flavor. A minor, malty sweetness. Slight alcohol in the finish.

## Conclusion
<em>My Antonia</em> is another great offering from Dogfish Head. Compared to their other rarities and extreme beers it's certainly tame, but is a good contrast for them. <em>My Antonia</em> falls right in line with the pilsner kick I've been on recently. Having said that, it's not my favorite imperial pilsner, that's currently reserved for Sweetwater Brewing Company's Magnum IP. As of this review, <em>My Antonia</em> isn't available in Georgia and I  grabbed this bottle on a recent trip to Florida. I'll certainly pick up  another bottle when given the opportunity. Why Florida get's this and  Georgie doesn't is beyond me...

<strong>Food pairings</strong>: Spicy Asian food.

<strong>Cellar-able</strong>: No, being a pilsner, this would not age well.

<strong>Comparable beers</strong>: Sweetwater Magnum IP and Sam Adams Hallertau Imperial Pilsner are two I've had.

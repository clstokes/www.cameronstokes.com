Despite temperatures dipping into single digits only 2 weeks ago and a supposed 6 more weeks of Winter according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day">Punxsutawney Phil</a>, it really looks and feels like Spring is on the way.  The past week has really warmed up and there is new growth on many of the plants in my yard, even some daylilies peaking out of the ground.

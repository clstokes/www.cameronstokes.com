Having taken up homebrewing lately, I decided to take it a step further and grow my own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hops">hops</a>.   After doing some research regarding growing hops in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)">Georgia</a>, of which there is very little information, I picked up the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Homebrewers-Garden-Easily-Prepare-Brewing/dp/1580170102/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1236737105&amp;sr=8-1">The Homebrewer's Garden</a>.  The section on hops is really short but has some good information on how to plant, care for, and harvest your own hops.

After waiting a few weeks for the hop <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome">rhizomes</a> to become available, I ordered from <a href="http://www.freshops.com/">Freshops</a> on March 1st and received my goods a few days later.  I ordered three varieties: Cascade, Chinook, and Willamette.

This past weekend I planted them on the farm up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogart,_Georgia">Bogart</a>.  It was the first nice weekend of the year and was a great excuse to get outside and have fun on the tractor.  The hops are split into three rows, one for each variety.

There are 23 vines (Freshops sent me extra Willamette on accident).  From what I've read we won't get much off them in the first year.  Next year I hope to be drowning in hops.

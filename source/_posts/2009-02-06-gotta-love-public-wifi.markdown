Our internet connection at home has been flaking out for the past few days and finally became intolerable today, with over 40% <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_loss">packet loss</a>.  We called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast">Comcast</a> and have a technician scheduled to come out next week.  Usually we'd get by just fine but Rhonda needed some files from work so she could catch up on a few things over the weeken dso we ventured out to the local <a href="http://www.tacomac.com/">Taco Mac</a> to take advantage of their free wifi.

Turns out their Wifi service is provided by <a href="http://www.wanderingwifi.com/">Wandering Wifi</a>.  The Wandering Wifi service requires you to sign up for an account but Rhonda and I were able to create one account and share it.  The wireless connection seems to drop every 5-10 minutes, I imagine it's the microwave being turned on back on the connection.  Out of curiosity I figured out their ISP is <a href="http://www.cbeyond.net/">Cbeyond</a>.

Anyway, we got our dose of the internet.  I tried two beers I had never had before; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Brewing_Company">Atlanta Brewing Company's</a> <a href="http://www.atlantabrewing.com/beer_peachtree.html">Peachtree Pale Ale</a> and their <a href="http://www.atlantabrewing.com/beer_blonde.html">Blonde Ale</a>.  For whatever reason I've never had these before even though they're brewed in Atlanta (obviously).  They're quite tasty, though my local favorite is still all the brews from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetwater_Brewing_Company">Sweetwater Brewing Company</a>.

A quick and disappointing update to my <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/2010/08/23/replacement-ups-batteries-refurbups-com/"><em>Replacement UPS batteries and RefurbUPS.com</em></a> post from last year. Unfortunately, one of the replacement UPS batteries from RefurbUPS has already died and the second one seems to be on the fritz as well. I contacted RefurbUPS through their website and haven't heard back. That was 3 months ago. Once this one finally goes kaput I'll be replacing it with an OEM battery.

I no longer recommend RefurbUPS.com.

I bought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_A_Watt">Kill A Watt</a> awhile back, though technically not a Kill A Watt but a <a href="http://www.seasonicusa.com/power_angel.htm">Seasonic Power Angel</a>, but since I bought it I haven't done much with.  I've mainly used it for quick measurements of my computer or monitor, nothing "scientific."  This past week I decided to figure out how much energy was used in my daily coffee-making ritual.

<img class="size-full wp-image-305" title="Seasonic Power Angel" src="http://cameronstokes.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/seasonic-power-angel.jpg" alt="Seasonic Power Angel" width="480" height="276" />

I plugged in the Power Angel on a Saturday morning and alternated plugging in my coffee maker (a <a href="http://www.technivorm.com/pages/products-home.html">Technivorm-Moccamaster KBT</a>) and coffee grinder (a <a href="http://www.delonghiusa.com/">Delonghi</a> I can't seem to find a link to now) to measure how much energy was used by both.  I made 7 cups (that sounds like a lot but is our usual morning amount) and did the same everyday for the next 7 days.

All in all, the week's worth of coffee making consumed 0.56 killowatt hours (kWh) of power.  Given <a href="http://www.psc.state.ga.us/electric/surveys/2008/allprowin08/allprowin08-500.asp">current prices of $0.088 per kWh</a> from <a href="http://www.mariettapower.com/">Marietta Power</a>, this comes out to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=0.088%2A0.56&amp;btnG=Search">$0.04928</a> for the week or roughly <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=0.088%2A0.56%2A52&amp;btnG=Search">$2.56</a> for the entire year.

Not having conducted an observation like this before, I'm surprised at the results, I was expecting higher numbers.  A nickel a week to make coffee is well worth it.

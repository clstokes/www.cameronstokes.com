title: Atlanta to Seattle - Day 3

<em>My fiancé Rhonda and I have picked up and moved to Seattle so that she can pursue a job at Boeing working on their 787 Dreamliner. We opted to make the cross-country drive rather than fly. This series of posts will be a recap of our drive. Here's our adventure...</em>
# Day 3
Day 3 we left smelly Lexington heading for Fort Collins, CO. The drive through the second-half of Nebraska was much like the first-half, boring and uneventful except for a burnt-out headlight. As mentioned in a previous post, my "get up and go" personality doesn't like not moving forward, so fixing it was not on the books.

The scenery changed almost immediately after passing the Nebraska-Colorado line. What was mostly drab plains and farmland became colorful rolling hills. Colorado was the first state that we saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine">wind turbines</a> (though my memory may be blurring the states...). For whatever reason I am mesmerized by these and would point them out to Rhonda whenever I spotted them. We saw almost as many turbines as we saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronghorn">pronghorn antelope</a>.

We planned for a short drive this day so we could visit <a href="http://www.newbelgium.com/">New Belgium Brewing</a> in the afternoon. Prior to the brewery though we checked in to our hotel and grabbed some lunch. We ate at <a href="http://www.wildboarcoffee.com/">Wild Boar Coffee</a> right next Colorado State University. Wild Boar's food was awesome and their beer list was equally impressive. I had <a href="http://www.odells.com/">Odell Brewing Company's</a> <a href="http://odellbrewing.com/beers/myrcenary">Myrcenary Double IPA</a> and Rhonda had Odell's <a href="http://odellbrewing.com/beers/classic/90_shilling">90 Shilling Ale</a>.

After lunch we made our way to New Belgium. Not wanting to leave the dogs cooped up in the truck for the 90-minute brewery tour we decided to hang out in the tasting room. Rhonda volunteered to drive so I could partake in New Belgium's numerous offerings. Blue Paddle was still my favorite of the day but Drew's Ale and <a href="http://www.newbelgium.com/beer/detail.aspx?id=6f2b4470-1255-4b85-b618-ec702fcf7a05">Abbey</a> were equally tasty. My least favorite was Sara's Red brewed with beets, licorice, fennel, and rosemary. I agreed with my server that the fennel and licorice were a bit redundant, especially since I like neither. Unlike breweries in Georgia, New Belgium is able to sell direct from the brewery including growlers. We filled up our growler with Blue Paddle, picked up a 12-pack of Sunshine and bombers of <a href="http://www.newbelgium.com/beer/detail.aspx?id=e5d60cce-6eea-4ef9-a300-0a46e8ce5123">Le Terroir</a> and <a href="http://www.newbelgium.com/beer/detail.aspx?id=629cd028-e87d-45d1-a068-a252e5db2cfd">Imperial Berliner-Weisse</a>, as well as a shirt for Rhonda and one for a friend back in Atlanta.

The highlights of the drive were the beautiful scenery of Colorado and of course our stop at New Belgium Brewing.

Total driving on day 3 was only 300 miles through Nebraska and Colorado.

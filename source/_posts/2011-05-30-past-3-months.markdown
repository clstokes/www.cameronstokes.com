In the past 3 months I have...
<ul>
	<li>Flown over 45,000 miles through 10 airports</li>
	<li>Driven over 1,000 miles acrossÂ Europe</li>
	<li>Driven over 3,000 miles across the U.S.</li>
	<li>Driven through 11 states</li>
	<li>Visited 10 countries across 3 continents</li>
	<li>Spent over 40 nights in hotels</li>
	<li><a href="http://cameronstokes.com/2011/04/24/something-new-atlanta-to-seattle/">Moved from Atlanta to Seattle</a></li>
</ul>
I am now settled into a new home and despite the stress of the extra travel and cross-country move, it's all been worth it.

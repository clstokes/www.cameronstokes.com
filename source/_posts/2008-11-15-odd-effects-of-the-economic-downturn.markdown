I was getting my '04 Tundra's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_emissions_control">emissions tested</a> this morning and asked the operator, Anthony, a couple questions regarding his business.

I was mainly curious how much revenue an emissions testing busines could bring in and based on Anthony's numbers it doesn't sound too bad.  Anthony's location charges $20 per vehicle and he said he averages about 20 vehicles a day, sometimes 30 on Mondays.  So $20 a vehicle, 20 vehicles a day, open 6 days a week and 50 weeks a year, comes out to about <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=20*20*6*50&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">$120,000</a> a year.  That's a good bit more than I would have thought.

What made the conversation more interesting was that Anthony said his business had been declining given the recent economy and he was lucky to do 15 vehicles a day.  How would the economy affect Anthony's business?  It's state law in Georgia (and all states as far as I know) to get your vehicle's emissions tested every year in order to renew your vehicle registration.  If it's truly the case that emissions testing is declining, that would mean we would see a corresponding decline in vehicle registrations.  Is everyone suddenly claiming their second and third cars are agricultural vehicles and thus <a href="http://motor.etax.dor.ga.gov/motor/titles/required.asp">don't require registration</a>?

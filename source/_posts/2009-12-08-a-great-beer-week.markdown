title: A great beer week

This past week has been a great beer week.  Last Tuesday we had dinner at the Westside location <a href="http://www.5seasonsbrewing.com/">5 Seasons Brewing Company</a> and enjoyed their beer sampler along with some great food.  Each of their beers was delicious, especially their IPA.  This was only the second time I've been to 5 Seasons; the first being at the Prado location where <span class="BodySubhead">Kevin McNerney brews, of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetwater_Brewing_Company">Sweetwater</a> fame.</span>

<span class="BodySubhead">Last weekend we </span>made our way down to Tampa for the ACC Championship Game (go <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology">Tech</a>!) and made sure to take advantage of the beers available in Florida and Tampa specifically that we can't get in Georgia.  Friday night, we grabbed dinner at the <a href="http://www.tampabaybrewingcompany.com/">Tampa Bay Brewing Company</a> and had great beers and great food.  Again I got their beer sampler which included each of their year-round beers and a cask-conditioned Moosekiller Barleywine; all very delicious.  I highly recommend Tampa Bay Brewing Company; in addition to the beer and food, the service was excellent.  Before the game on Saturday we stopped by a Total Wine and stocked up on the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogfish_Head_Brewery">Dogfish Head</a> 120 Minute IPA as well as Dogfish Head's Shelter Pale Ale, Raison d'Extra, Fort, and Theobroma, <a href="http://www.cigarcitybeer.com/">Cigar City Brewing's</a> General Zhukov's Imperial Stout and Improvisacion Ale, and <a href="http://www.lazymagnolia.com/">Lazy Magnolia's</a> Southern Pecan and Indian Summer.  I've since tried a 120 Minute IPA but haven't made it to the others yet.  I had to reorganize the beer fridge in order to fit everything.  Here's the full score from Florida:

Back in Georgia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrapin_Beer_Company">Terrapin</a> has released their Hopsecutioner IPA.  I am a total hophead and this beer does not disappoint.  I'm actually quite proud of myself as this is the first beer I've successfully identified a hop in the beer by taste alone.  A couple weeks ago I had Rogue's <a href="http://www.rogue.com/beers/yellow-snow-ipa.php">Yellow Snow IPA</a> and remarked how different the hop profile was from a typical IPA.  I can taste the same hop in the Hopsecutioner: Amarillo.  I've yet to make a homebrew using this hop, but this has moved up the list on things to try.  I love the flavor of this hop.

If only more weeks could be like this...

I'm wrapping up my trip to Salt Lake City and about to check out of the <a href="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/hi/1/en/hotel/slcff">Holiday Inn Salt Lake City - Airport West</a>, a great hotel currently going through the <a href="http://relaunch.holidayinn.com/">Holiday Inn Relaunch</a> initiative.  My boss and I flew out here last Friday to visit one of InterContinental Hotels Group's call centers to discuss some of the applications we're developing for the agents.

We came a couple days early to get some skiing in beforehand and were lucky enough to get out here on the last weekend of the ski season for almost all of the resorts around Salt Lake.  We went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowbasin">Snowbasin</a> on Saturday and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_City,_Utah">Park City</a> on Sunday.

After skiing Saturday and Sunday we got to work Monday and had two full days of meeting with the local team and observing our call center agents using the applications my team has written and assisting our customers.  I sat with several agents to get their feedback on the applications and see how they perform "from the trenches."

Highlights of the trip:

* Seeing the vice-presidential motorcade roll out the back of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-17_Globemaster_III">C-17</a> at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert-St._Louis_International_Airport">St. Louis airport</a>.
* Getting a terrible sunburn on my face from the first day skiing at Snowbasin.
* Skiing on the last day of the season at Park City.
* Using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Sync_Framework">Microsoft Sync</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth">Bluetooth</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_Bold">Blackberry Bold</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora_(music_service)">Pandora</a> in our rental car to stream music to the stereo system.
* Visiting two brewpubs in downtown Salt Lake City, <a href="http://www.redrockbrewing.com/">Red Rock Brewing Company</a> and <a href="http://www.squatters.com/">Squatters</a>.
* Finding out Utah is now more relaxed about alcohol sales than Georgia.
* Using a Windows XP guest inside <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox">VirtualBox</a> to transfer photos from my camera which isn't recognized by Mac OS X on my Macbook.

It's Wednesday morning and I feel like I've already worked a full week; the trip was well worth it.  Photos from the trip are <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/salt-lake-city-april-2009/">here</a>.

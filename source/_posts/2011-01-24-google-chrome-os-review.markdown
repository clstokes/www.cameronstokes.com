Ever since <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html">Google Chrome OS</a> was announced in July of 2009 I've been looking forward to seeing what hits the streets. Fortunately, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome_OS#Cr-48_prototype_hardware">Cr-48 Chrome OS laptop</a> landed on my desk today and I've spent the evening trying it out.

Given that the laptop is "prototype" hardware I'll keep my review to the OS itself. For brevity's sake, I'll keep this to a stream of consciousness type review:
<ul>
	<li>Initial startup only took a few seconds then after setup of the wireless it took a few minutes to download the OS updates. <em>So far so good.</em></li>
	<li>Once signed in, I'm taken to a Chrome browser window and a well-designed Get Started page. <em>Meh.</em></li>
	<li>I immediately go to <em>Settings</em> and find not much there. <em>Meh.</em></li>
	<li>Loading my most common tabs everything seems pretty snappy. <em>Good.</em></li>
	<li>I open up my WordPress Admin and start this review, take a photo of the Cr-48 box and wonder how I'm going to load the photos from my camera. Plugging in the camera (a five-year old Sony DSC-W50) I'm able to load the photos straight from the mounted disk, though there's no easy way to browse and look at multiple photos. <em>Surprised it worked at all.</em></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.picnik.com/">picnik</a> works perfectly on Chrome OS to resize the photo. <em>Cool.</em></li>
	<li>I can't figure out how to unmount the camera, so I just unplug it. <em>Boo.</em></li>
	<li>Having opened up about 15 tabs I start to wish I could pull a few out into different windows and alt-tab between them. Never has a favicon been more important. <em>Boo.</em></li>
	<li>All the while, everything is pretty snappy. There's a noticeable, but tolerable slowdown when loading multiple pages in the background.Â <em>Meh.</em></li>
	<li>Page rendering is quick but other page operations such as finding text on a page is slower than normal. Tab switching starts to slow as well. <em>Meh.</em></li>
	<li>After having many tabs open for a while, I can notice Chrome OS start to preserve resources and "hide" background pages. The tabs are still there but switching to them triggers the browser to repaint the page. <em>Meh.</em></li>
	<li>Pasting within my blog post cause the page to scroll vertically at times, but not every time. <em>Annoying.</em></li>
	<li>Opening Pandora, Flash is noticeably slower, but is functional. <em>Good (if only for Pandora).</em></li>
	<li>Google Docs is frustrating to use. There's a noticeable delay in edits and moving around in spreadsheets and documents. <em>Boo.</em></li>
	<li>There's no way to take screenshots within Chrome OS. <em>Boo.</em></li>
	<li>Waking the laptop from sleep is ridiculously fast. <em>Awesome.</em></li>
</ul>
As a software architect that still dabbles in code, Chrome OS certainly can't cut it for me. I need a terminal, the ability to install additional "real" applications, Java, an IDE, etc. but I expect Chrome OS would suffice for 90% of the population.

From a hardware perspective Cr-48 hardware is definitely a "prototype" and detracts from the overall experience. For casual browsing it suffices, but I can't see myself using the Cr-48 for long periods of time.

All in all, I'm impressed and I tend to fling more insults at Google than complements. Given the success of the iPad and the "limited" features of Chrome OS, it seems a tablet is a more likely form factor for Chrome OS than a laptop. Microsoft and to a lesser extent Apple should be worried.

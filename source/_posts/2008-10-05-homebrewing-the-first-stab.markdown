title: Homebrewing...The First Stab.

A friend and I decided to take our hand at homebrewing beer.  After doing a bit research we found a local wine making and beer brewing supply shop, <a href="http://winecraftatl.com/">Wine Craft of Atlanta</a>, and decided to venture over and check it out.  The shop owner, Rick Adams (and his wife Peggy whom we haven't met yet), was extremely helpful and put up with our countless questions on how homebrewing works, what to buy, what not to buy, etc., and we left with a beer starter equipment kit and an English Pale Ale ingredient kit.  I'm usually one to buy everything online to save some money, but not knowing exactly what to buy Rick's advice was priceless and his prices were roughly the same if not cheaper than the stores online, especially when not having to pay for shipping.

Fast forward a couple weeks, the kit had been sitting idle since we bought it and we finally made time for brewing.  Making the wort took a couple hours, meanwhile our house smelled delicious and reminded me of all my trips to the <a href="http://www.sweetwaterbrew.com/">Sweetwater Brewery</a> (brewery photos are <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/gallery/sweetwater_brewery_july_2007/">here</a>).

After making and cooling the wort (which required an emergency trip out to pick up ice), everything was moved to the primary fermenter and left to ferment.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_(beer)">initial gravity</a> was 1.041.  After a day of expecting "vigorous fermenting" I became worried when our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_lock">airlock</a> didn't seem to be doing much.  I emailed Rick asking for help and then realized that we forgot to add water to the airlock.  Rick assured us that everything would be fine we just needed to take a gravity readying to see where we were in the process.  The gravity reading of 1.015 meant everything was on course, and we let it sit for another couple days.  After about 5 total days in the fermenter, and a final reading of 1.015 it was time to bottle.

Bottling began by taking inventory of how many bottles we had collected and realizing we were short (we needed about 2 cases worth).  We grudgingly drank a few more beers, proceeded to sanitize the bottles and equipment, and bottled.  We setup an assembly line of a filler, a passer, and a capper.  We ended up with 40 12 oz. bottles and 3 22 oz. bottles filled with what will hopefully be some delicious English Pale ale.

I hereby name this brew, <em>The First Stab</em>.

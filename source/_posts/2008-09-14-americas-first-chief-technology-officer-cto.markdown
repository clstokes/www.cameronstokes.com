<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Scoble">Robert Scoble</a> wrote a blog posting a few weeks week back entitled <em><a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/08/21/who-should-be-usas-cto/">Who should be USA’s CTO?</a></em> In it he discussed the proposition that America needs a CTO, an idea proposed by Barack Obama (see his Technology Issues page <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/issues/technology/">here</a>), and also who could be up up for the job.

These are the names he posted:

* Mark Andreessen
* Dave Winer
* Joel Spolsky
* Tantek Celik
* Molly Holzschlag
* Meg Whitman
* Bill Gates
* Steve Wozniak
* Caterina Fake

Some of these I had never heard of (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer">Dave Winer</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantek_Çelik">Tantek Celik</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Holzschlag">Molly Holzchalg</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterina_Fake">Caterina Fake</a>), some of these are ridiculous (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky">Joel Spolsky</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meg_Whitman">Meg Whitman</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>) and some are feasible but still not the right person in my opinion (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">Marc Andreesen</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates">Bill Gates</a>).

Robert obviously picked some of the most popular <em>technology</em> people out there, but they're all <em>technology</em> people that run <em>technology</em> companies and that's not what America needs in a CTO.  In my opinion we need a CTO from a <em>non-technology company</em>; a CTO from a company like GE or Bank of America or Toyota; someone who helps further their company through the use of technology.

Having taken a <a href="http://cameronstokes.com/2009/01/04/2008-in-review/">look back at 2008</a>, it's time to look forward to 2009.  Here are my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_resolution">New Year's resolutions</a>:

* <strong>Plan more</strong> - Be more proactive and less reactive.
* <strong>Spend less</strong> - Reduce money spent on luxury items, particularly eating out.
* <strong>Consume less</strong> - Not from an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-consumerism">anti-consumerism</a> perspective, but from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource">resource</a> perspective e.g. paper, plastic, water, fossil fuels, etc.
* <strong>Post more</strong> - Post here more frequently.
* <strong>Exercise</strong> - At least 4 times a week.
* <strong>Eat better</strong> - Reinstate my "don't finish your plate" diet.
* <strong>Drink more beer</strong> - Not in quantity but variety.
* <strong>Brew more beer</strong> -  Learn to brew good beer consistently.
* <strong>Read more</strong> - Catch up on all the books I bought last year.
* <strong>Adopt a mile</strong> -  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adopt_a_Highway">Adopt a road</a> near my neighborhood.

I'll revisit this list throughout the year and certainly at year-end to see how I've done.

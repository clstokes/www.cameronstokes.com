Twitter has dropped another version on its users, affectionately dubbed #newnewtwitter, with even more changes than #newtwitter. Twitter has details of the changes [here](http://fly.twitter.com/).

While I like most of the aesthetic changes, I don't like that the _dashboard_ panel is now on the left side of the screen as opposed to the right. With a few lines in a greasemonkey/userscript, I've restored order to twitter.

See the details of my _#newnewtwitter-tweaker_ script [here](https://github.com/clstokes/scraps/tree/master/newnewtwitter-tweaker) or go straight to the download [here](https://github.com/clstokes/scraps/raw/master/newnewtwitter-tweaker/newnewtwitter.user.js).

I consider myself a very focused and productive person, but over the past couple of weeks I've realized that I am much more productive when working from a task list.  The list keeps my mind from wondering to other tasks and I get a great satisfaction in checking tasks off  and reviewing the list at the end of the day to see what I have accomplished.  I have some ideas on how to improve my list (and digitize it); let's see how much more productive I can get!

This week's task list:

Almost eighteen months ago, I found the Google Street View guy near work and followed him for a bit trying to stay in view.  For several weeks following I checked the location online nearly every day and eventually gave up.  Thanks to a commenter on my original post I checked again and we are there.  They removed the frames of us hanging out the window talking to the driver, but there I am in the driver seat.

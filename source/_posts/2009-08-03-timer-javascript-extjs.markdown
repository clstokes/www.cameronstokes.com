_Updated after migrating my blog off of Wordpress._

Every once in a while I'll put together a one-off script or application to help solve a problem or save myself time by automating something.  These rarely leave my computer but I figure some of them could be helpful to someone else, hence I've setup my <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><a href="#">Lab</a></span> <a href="https://github.com/clstokes">GitHub profile</a>.  The lab is where I will showcase anything I've hacked together that I think is worth sharing.

The first item in the lab is a <a href="https://github.com/clstokes/extjs-timer">Timer</a> I've written using using JavaScript, <a href="http://www.extjs.com/">ExtJS</a> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">, and <a href="http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/">SoundManager 2</a></span>.  After setting the hours, minutes, and seconds that you want to time, click Start, and the application will countdown and then play an alarm sound once the countdown is complete.

I wrote this for 2 main reasons: (1) to build something using ExtJS and (2) to have a timer that wasn't surrounded by ads, blinked at me, or otherwise annoyed me.  The source is available <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">from the application page</span> on GitHub.  The next iteration of the timer should be out soon allowing you to set multiple timers to be executed in sequence, i.e. reminding you when to start or stop steps in an exercise or recipe.

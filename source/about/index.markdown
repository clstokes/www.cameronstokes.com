My name is Cameron Stokes and this is my personal website. Here you’ll find my musings about about [Technology](/category/tech/), [Beer](/category/beer/), and [Other](/category/other/) stuff.

I grew up and lived in Atlanta, GA for 28 years until in April of 2011 my fiance Rhonda and I picked up, drove cross-country, and moved to Seattle. We like it in Seattle. (We liked Atlanta too…)

I currently work for InterContinental Hotels Group as Applications Architect on their consumer web channel. Prior to that I worked on their business-to-business and call-center channels. My professional experience has centered around Java, but I’m a generalist, having used ASP, PHP, bash, Ruby, Python, and Groovy.

Outside of work I continue to dabble in whatever latest technology has caught my attention. I brew my own beer, try to drink every unique brewery/style/beer I can get my hands on, pretend I know what I’m doing with my DSLR, play with my dogs, and generally always have music playing in the background.

Some other things to know about me:

* Married to [Rhonda Griffin](https://twitter.com/#!/RhondaDonda642)
* I like all kinds of music, especially “hillbilly music” as Rhonda calls it
* My latest, favorite song is [We Are Young](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv6dMFF_yts) by Fun	(as of Jun 2012)
* I am really good at finding software bugs and even better at fixing them
* I love to travel
* I have a knack for ordering beers that bars have run out of
* I have 2 dogs: Blue and Violet
* I like making decisions based on data, but trust my gut too
* I love zombie, dystopian, post-apocalyptic stories
* I enjoy infographics
* I am quick to notice issues with usability and user experience
* It bothers me when when things don’t line up straight and/or are asymmetrical

My name is Cameron Stokes and this is my personal website. Here you’ll find my musings about about [Technology](/category/tech/), [Beer](/category/beer/), and [Other](/category/other/) stuff.

I grew up and lived in Atlanta, GA for 28 years until in April of 2011 my fiance Rhonda and I picked up, drove cross-country, and moved to Seattle. We like it in Seattle. (We liked Atlanta too…)

I currently work for InterContinental Hotels Group as Applications Architect on their e-commerce channel (earning $3 billion a year in revenue). Prior to that I worked on their business-to-business and call-center channels. My professional experience has centered around Java, but I’m a generalist, having used ASP, PHP, Ruby, Python, and Groovy.

Outside of work I dabble in whatever latest technology has caught my attention. I brew my own beer, try to drink every unique brewery/style/beer I can get my hands on, pretend I know what I’m doing with my DSLR, play with my dogs, and generally always have music playing in the background.

Some other things to know about me:

* Married to [Rhonda Griffin](https://twitter.com/#!/RhondaDonda642)
* I like all kinds of music, especially “hillbilly music” as Rhonda calls it
* My latest, favorite song is [Some Nights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQkBeOisNM0) by Fun (as of Jun 2012)
* I am really good at finding software bugs and even better at fixing them
* I love to travel
* I have a knack for ordering beers that bars have run out of
* I have <ins>1 dog</ins> <del>2 dogs</del>: Violet <del>[and Blue](https://twitter.com/clstokes/status/185581016713396225)</del> 
* I like testing theories, but also trust my gut
* I love zombie, dystopian, post-apocalyptic stories
* I am quick to notice bad usability/user experience
